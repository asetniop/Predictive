 Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life or whether that station will be held by anybody else these pages must show To begin my life with the beginning of my life I record that I was born as I have been informed and believe on a Friday at twelve oclock at night It was remarked that the clock began to strike and I began to cry simultaneously 
 
 In consideration of the day and hour of my birth it was declared by the nurse and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted first that I was destined to be unlucky in life and secondly that I was privileged to see ghosts and spirits both these gifts inevitably attaching as they believed to all unlucky infants of either gender born towards the small hours on a Friday night 
 
 I need say nothing here on the first head because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result On the second branch of the question I will only remark that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still a baby I have not come into it yet But I do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it he is heartily welcome to keep it 
 
 I was born with a caul which was advertised for sale in the newspapers at the low price of fifteen guineas Whether sea-going people were short of money about that time or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets I don't know all I know is that there was but one solitary bidding and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-broking business who offered two pounds in cash and the balance in sherry but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss-for as to sherry my poor dear mother's own sherry was in the market then-and ten years afterwards the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country to fifty members at half-a-crown a head the winner to spend five shillings I was present myself and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused at a part of myself being disposed of in that way The caul was won I recollect by an old lady with a hand-basket who very reluctantly produced from it the stipulated five shillings all in halfpence and twopence halfpenny short-as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic to endeavour without any effect to prove to her It is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there that she was never drowned but died triumphantly in bed at ninety-two I have understood that it was to the last her proudest boast that she never had been on the water in her life except upon a bridge and that over her tea to which she was extremely partial she to the last expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others who had the presumption to go meandering about the world It was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences tea perhaps included resulted from this objectionable practice She always returned with greater emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection Let us have no meandering 
 
 Not to meander myself at present I will go back to my birth 
 
 I was born at Blunderstone in Suffolk or there by as they say in Scotland I was a posthumous child My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months when mine opened on it There is something strange to me even now in the reflection that he never saw me and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the churchyard and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle and the doors of our house were-almost cruelly it seemed to me sometimes-bolted and locked against it 
 
 An aunt of my father's and consequently a great-aunt of mine of whom I shall have more to relate by and by was the principal magnate of our family Miss Trotwood or Miss Betsey as my poor mother always called her when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable personage to mention her at all which was seldom had been married to a husband younger than herself who was very handsome except in the sense of the homely adage handsome is that handsome does-for he was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey and even of having once on a disputed question of supplies made some hasty but determined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs window These evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him off and effect a separation by mutual consent He went to India with his capital and there according to a wild legend in our family he was once seen riding on an elephant in company with a Baboon but I think it must have been a Baboo-or a Begum Anyhow from India tidings of his death reached home within ten years How they affected my aunt nobody knew for immediately upon the separation she took her maiden name again bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off established herself there as a single woman with one servant and was understood to live secluded ever afterwards in an inflexible retirement 
 
 My father had once been a favourite of hers I believe but she was mortally affronted by his marriage on the ground that my mother was a wax doll She had never seen my mother but she knew her to be not yet twenty My father and Miss Betsey never met again He was double my mother's age when he married and of but a delicate constitution He died a year afterwards and as I have said six months before I came into the world 
 
 This was the state of matters on the afternoon of what I may be excused for calling that eventful and important Friday I can make no claim therefore to have known at that time how matters stood or to have any remembrance founded on the evidence of my own senses of what follows 
 
 My mother was sitting by the fire but poorly in health and very low in spirits looking at it through her tears and desponding heavily about herself and the fatherless little stranger who was already welcomed by some grosses of prophetic pins in a drawer upstairs to a world not at all excited on the subject of his arrival my mother I say was sitting by the fire that bright windy March afternoon very timid and sad and very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her when lifting her eyes as she dried them to the window opposite she saw a strange lady coming up the garden 
 
 MY mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance that it was Miss Betsey The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady over the garden-fence and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to nobody else 
 
 When she reached the house she gave another proof of her identity My father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any ordinary Christian and now instead of ringing the bell she came and looked in at that identical window pressing the end of her nose against the glass to that extent that my poor dear mother used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment 
 
 She gave my mother such a turn that I have always been convinced I am indebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday 
 
 My mother had left her chair in her agitation and gone behind it in the corner Miss Betsey looking round the room slowly and inquiringly began on the other side and carried her eyes on like a Saracen's Head in a Dutch clock until they reached my mother Then she made a frown and a gesture to my mother like one who was accustomed to be obeyed to come and open the door My mother went 
 
 Mrs David Copperfield I think said Miss Betsey the emphasis referring perhaps to my mother's mourning weeds and her condition 
 
 Yes said my mother faintly 
 
 Miss Trotwood said the visitor You have heard of her I dare say 
 
 My mother answered she had had that pleasure And she had a disagreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering pleasure 
 
 Now you see her said Miss Betsey My mother bent her head and begged her to walk in 
 
 They went into the parlour my mother had come from the fire in the best room on the other side of the passage not being lighted-not having been lighted indeed since my father's funeral and when they were both seated and Miss Betsey said nothing my mother after vainly trying to restrain herself began to cry Oh tut tut tut said Miss Betsey in a hurry Don't do that Come come 
 
 My mother couldn't help it notwithstanding so she cried until she had had her cry out 
 
 Take off your cap child said Miss Betsey and let me see you 
 
 MY mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request if she had any disposition to do so Therefore she did as she was told and did it with such nervous hands that her hair which was luxuriant and beautiful fell all about her face 
 
 Why bless my heart exclaimed Miss Betsey You are a very Baby 
 
 My mother was no doubt unusually youthful in appearance even for her years she hung her head as if it were her fault poor thing and said sobbing that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow and would be but a childish mother if she lived In a short pause which ensued she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair and that with no ungentle hand but looking at her in her timid hope she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up her hands folded on one knee and her feet upon the fender frowning at the fire

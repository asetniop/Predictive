The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place 
The jury further said in term end presentments that the City Executive Committee which had over all charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted 
The September *october term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hard fought primary which was won by Mayor nominate Ivan Allen Jr 
Only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city 
The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous 
It recommended that Fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them 
The grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments 
Merger proposed however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration 
The City Purchasing Department the jury said is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies 
It urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem 
Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury 
It urged that the next Legislature provide enabling funds and re set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected 
The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes 
This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program the jury said but the State Welfare Department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County which receives none of this money 
The jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties 
Nevertheless we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said 
Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on Fulton taxpayers 
The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation 
Wards protected the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee 
These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said 
Regarding Atlanta's new multi million dollar airport the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge Jan 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences 
The jury did not elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable 
Ask jail deputies on other matters the jury recommended that  1 four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and a doctor medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail 
2 Fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for city employes 
The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department 
Mayor William B Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife Pearl Williams Hartsfield in Fulton Superior Court Friday 
His petition charged mental cruelty 
The couple was married Aug 2 1913 
They have a son William Berry Jr  and a daughter Mrs J M Cheshire of Griffin 
Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon 
The petition listed the mayor's occupation as attorney and his age as 71 
It listed his wife's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika Ala 
The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year 
The Hartsfield home is at 637 E Pelham Rd *j 
Henry L Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorney 
Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta with exception of one brief interlude since 1937 
His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 
The mayor's present term of office expires Jan 1 
He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr  who became a candidate in the Sept 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection 
Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race a top official said Wednesday 
Robert Snodgrass state *j chairman said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience 
State Party Chairman James W Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen John Tower will be the featured speaker 
In the Blue Ridge meeting the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters 
Despite the warning there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate according to Republicans who attended 
When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race it voted no  and there were no dissents 
The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race one of two alternative courses must be taken  1 five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot or 2 the Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system  a system which the party opposes in its platform 
Sam Caldwell State Highway Department public relations director resigned Tuesday to work for Lt Gov Garland Byrd's campaign 
Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some time 
He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville who has been an assistant more than three years 
When the gubernatorial campaign starts Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd 
The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home  where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly 
Before adjournment Monday afternoon the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made 
Gov Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment 
Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item 
Construction bonds meanwhile it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds 
The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways 
A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work 
A revolving fund the department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities 
Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov Marvin Griffin 
The Highway Department source told The Constitution however that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds 
Schley County Rep B D Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances 
Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the quickie vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought 
While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87 31 
A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29 5 
As of Sunday night there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action 
Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions 
A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education something it has consistently opposed in the past 
Rep Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to endorse increased federal support for public education provided that such funds be received and expended as state funds 
Barber who is in his 13th year as a legislator said there are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it  the resolution  passed 
But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution 
The resolution which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday will be formally read Monday 
It says that in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds the State Board of Education should be directed to give priority to teacher pay raises 
Colquitt  after a long hot controversy Miller County has a new school superintendent elected as a policeman put it in the coolest election I ever saw in this county 
The new school superintendent is Harry Davis a veteran agriculture teacher who defeated Felix Bush a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee 
Davis received 1 119 votes in Saturday's election and Bush got 402 
Ordinary Carey Williams armed with a pistol stood by at the polls to insure order 
This was the coolest calmest election I ever saw Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said 
Being at the polls was just like being at church 
I didn't smell a drop of liquor and we didn't have a bit of trouble 
The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet however 
It was marked by controversy anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence 
The former county school superintendent George P Callan shot himself to death March 18 four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board 
During the election campaign both candidates Davis and Bush reportedly received anonymous telephone calls 
Ordinary Williams said he too was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election 
Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election 
Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise 
Everything went real smooth the sheriff said 
There wasn't a bit of trouble 
Austin Texas  committee approval of Gov Price Daniel's abandoned property act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers 
Daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation 
Under committee rules it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week 
But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it 
Daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug 31 
He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books since Texas was a republic 
It permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more 
The bill which Daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer 
The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property Daniel declared 
Dewey Lawrence a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers 
If you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy he said 
You take out of circulation many millions of dollars 
Rep Charles E Hughes of Sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies 
His contention was denied by several bankers including Scott Hudson of Sherman Gaynor B Jones of Houston J B Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin 
Cox argued that the bill is probably unconstitutional since he said it would impair contracts 
He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing since the bill was introduced only last Monday 
Austin Texas  senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties 
The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state 
There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House 
It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300 000 or more population require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here 
Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas Harris Bexar Tarrant and El Paso would be $451 500 which would be a savings of $157 460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88 000 was absorbed Parkhouse told the Senate 
The *j estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school 
Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps V E  Red  Berry and Joe Ratcliff 
While details are still to be worked out Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected 
We're getting more pro letters than con on horse race betting said Ratcliff 
But I believe if people were better informed on this question most of them would oppose it also 
I'm willing to stake my political career on it 
Rep Berry an ex gambler from San Antonio got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies 
A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report although the resolution faces hard sledding later 
The house passed finally and sent to the Senate a bill extending the State Health Department's authority to give planning assistance to cities 
The senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees passing the three on the calendar 
One validated acts of school districts 
Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District 
The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted 
Without dissent senators passed a bill by Sen A R Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district 
Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site 
Two tax revision bills were passed 
One by Sen Louis Crump of San Saba would aid more than 17 000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized 
Instead retailers would sign a certificate of correctness violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison plus a $1 000 fine 
It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League 
The other bill by Sen A M Aikin Jr of Paris would relieve real estate brokers who pay their own annual licensing fee from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds 
Natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain under a bill by Sen Frank Owen 3 of El Paso to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas 
Marshall Formby of Plainview former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress eliminating the need for costly special elections 
Under Formby's plan an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor lieutenant governor speaker of the House attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court 
Austin Texas  state representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay 
An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot when Texas votes on a U *s senator 
Rep Wesley Roberts of Seminole sponsor of the poll idea said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill 
The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb 22 
The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval by two thirds majorities before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot Roberts said 
Opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice 
All Dallas members voted with Roberts except Rep Bill Jones who was absent 
Austin Texas  Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday 
Rep James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise a Wise County hamlet of 250 people 
When the shouting ended the bill passed 114 to 4 sending it to the Senate where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen George Parkhouse of Dallas 
Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen Parkhouse 
The bill would increase from $5 000 000 to $15 000 000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project 
Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas 
Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill did not sway Cotten's attack 
The bill's defenders were mostly small town legislators like J W Buchanan of Dumas Eligio  Kika  De La Garza of Mission Sam F Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs 
This is a poor boy's bill said Chapman 
Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds 
This would help the little peanut districts 
Austin Texas  a Houston teacher now serving in the Legislature proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning educational methods 
Rep Henry C Grover who teaches history in the Houston public schools would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so called teaching methods courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate 
A normal year's work in college is 30 semester hours 
Grover also would require junior senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching 
The remainder of the 4 year college requirement would be in general subjects 
A person with a master's degree in physics chemistry math or English yet who has not taken Education courses is not permitted to teach in the public schools said Grover 
College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses 
Fifty three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co signers of the proposal 
Paris Texas  sp    the board of regents of Paris Junior College has named Dr Clarence Charles Clark of Hays Kan as the school's new president 
Dr Clark will succeed Dr J R Mc*lemore who will retire at the close of the present school term 
Dr Clark holds an earned Doctor of Education degree from the University of Oklahoma 
He also received a Master of Science degree from Texas *j & *j College and a Bachelor of Science degree from Southwestern State College Weatherford Okla 
In addition Dr Clark has studied at Rhode Island State College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
During his college career Dr Clark was captain of his basketball team and was a football letterman 
Dr Clark has served as teacher and principal in Oklahoma high schools as teacher and athletic director at Raymondville Texas High School as an instructor at the University of Oklahoma and as an associate professor of education at Fort Hays Kan  State College 
He has served as a border patrolman and was in the Signal Corps of the U *s Army 
Denton Texas  sp    principals of the 13 schools in the Denton Independent School District have been re elected for the 1961 62 session upon the recommendation of Supt Chester O Strickland 
State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a blue ribbon citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program 
The report culminating a year long study of the *j program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring *j case load 
The report called racial discrimination in employment one of the most serious causes of family breakdown desertion and *j dependency 
Must solve problem the monthly cost of *j to more than 100 000 recipients in the county is 4 4 million dollars said C Virgil Martin president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co  committee chairman 
We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon *j for subsistence Martin said 
The volume of *j cases will decrease Martin reported when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems  relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color 
These he said are two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to *j 
Calls for extension other recommendations made by the committee are  extension of the *j program to all children in need living with any relatives including both parents as a means of preserving family unity 
Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy 
Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest Judge James B Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday 
The disclosure by Charles Bellows chief defense counsel startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial 
Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client Alan Clements 30 a separate trial 
Bellows made the request while the all woman jury was out of the courtroom 
Fears prejudicial aspects the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client Bellows told the court 
Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property 
It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others 
Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this 
Yes your honor replied Bellows 
What this amounts to if true is that there will be a free for all fight in this case 
There is a conflict among the defendants 
Washington July 24  President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio 
The President spent much of the week end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone 
Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port Mass  a White House spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion 
Decisions are made asked to elaborate Pierre Salinger White House press secretary replied I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts 
Salinger said the work President Kennedy advisers and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the city 
The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M Karns who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means 
Karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the 50 persons 
He said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens 
Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases 
In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case 
Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J Wexler special prosecutor 
Issue jury subpoenas Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building but did not take them before the grand jury 
Mayer Goldberg attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward argued this procedure constituted intimidation 
Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning 
Karns said it was a wrongful act for Wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room 
He said this constituted a very serious misuse of the Criminal court processes 
Actually the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court said Karns who is a City judge in East St Louis sitting in Cook County court 
Faced seven cases Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons 
Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary miscount of the vote in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another 
The cases involved judges in the 33d 24th and 42d precincts of the 31st ward the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward the 18th precinct of the 4th ward and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward 
The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns 
Two other cases also were under advisement 
Claims precedent lacking after reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he would dismiss them 
Washington Feb 9  President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14 2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs 
The President in a special message to Congress tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools and expand child health care and general medical research 
The aged care plan similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator a fight on Capitol hill 
It was defeated in Congress last year 
Cost up to $37 a year it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes 
The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent  3 per cent on each worker and employer  on the first $4 800 of pay per year 
The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5 000 a year and the payroll tax to 6 5 per cent  3 25 per cent each 
Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system 
The payroll tax would actually rise to 7 5 per cent starting Jan 1 1963 if the plan is approved because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs 
Outlays would increase officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1 5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year 1963 
Both figures would go higher in later years 
Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years 
These would be paid for out of general not payroll taxes 
Nursing home care the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems  1 full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days 
2 full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital 
A patient could receive up to 300 days paid for nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital care credit 
3 hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient 
4 community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness 
The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged 
Calls proposal modest he said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings  or those of their children  caused by an extended hospital stay 
This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals 
This is not a program of socialized medicine 
It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed 
Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital 
Wouldn't pay doctors the plan does not cover doctor bills 
They would still be paid by the patient 
Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools 
The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care 
Moreover he said many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costs 
Contributions to schools the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1 500 a year for one fourth of the first year students 
The schools could use the money to pay 4 year scholarships based on need of up to $2 000 a year per student 
In addition the government would pay a $1 000 cost of education grant to the schools for each $1 500 in scholarship grants 
Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5 1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 
The President recommended federal matching grants totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones 
More for nursing homes in the area of community health services the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction 
He asked for another 10 million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory grants to states to improve nursing homes 
He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals 
In the child health field the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau 
He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute 
Asks research funds the President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation 
He did not say by how much 
For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase from 30 to 50 millions in matching grants for building research facilities 
The President said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the 540 million dollars in the 1961 62 budget for direct government research in medicine 
The President said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program  people knowledge services facilities and the means to pay for them 
Reaction as expected congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines 
Legislators who last year opposed placing aged care under the social security system criticized the President's plan 
Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message 
Senate Republican Leader Dirksen  Ill  and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck  Ind  said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance 
Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first 
House Speaker Sam Rayburn  D  Tex  called the Kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction on its fate in the House 
Washington Feb 9  acting hastily under White House pressure the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C Weaver as the nation's federal housing chief 
Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote 
A number of scattered ayes and noes was heard 
Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency 
In the last eight years all Presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor 
Enforce by demand the rule was enforced by demand of Sen Wayne Morse  D  Ore  in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961 
Oslo the most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer franker and wider discussions animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings 
This has been a working session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes 
In Oslo the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems 
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems 
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa exacerbated by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about has been conspicuous by its absence 
Explosion avoided in the case of Portugal which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the *j Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension 
The general remarkably courteous explanation has left basic positions unchanged but there has been no explosion in the council 
There should even be no more bitter surprises in the *j General Assembly as to *j members' votes since a new ad hoc *j committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance 
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the *j locomotive 
Even Norway despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance is today closer to the *j line 
On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for 
One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as inconclusive 
But he hastened to add that if United States policies were not always clear despite Mr Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy 
Exploratory mood a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited 
The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite Mr Rusk's personal popularity that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots 
The Secretary of State himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months 
But where the core of *j is concerned the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at *j disposal in European waters 
The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole 
Conflict surveyed the secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of *j realization that East *west friction wherever it take place around the globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection 
The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions  more deeper and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  when ratified  as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent 
This increase in the threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come 
Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down but never completely fulfilled 
Washington the Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time 
There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos 
The United States State Department officials explain now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam 
They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this 
The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated 
But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility 
Policies modified the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease fire in Laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference 
This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make 
It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration 
Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas 
But with the months moving on  and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world  the question arises  how effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression 
Former Vice *president Richard M Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union 
He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory 
*j G*o*p restrained it does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it 
They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans if they had been in power would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in Cuba 
One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration on this score 
His reply he said was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now 
But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first 
The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B Morton  R  of Kentucky chairman of the Republican National Committee that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination 
Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard Boston University Brandeis and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators 
Detente urged this group pleads with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups 
It recommends that the United States seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations  and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds 
Mr Nixon for his part would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation 
But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated 
Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected generally the opinions voiced both by Mr Nixon and the professors 
Aid plans revamped very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels a high official source disclosed that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration 
Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements 
Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed 
But thus far there has been no response in kind 
Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations 
In Laos the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture 
Again and again it asked the Communists to freeze the military situation in Laos 
But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate 
And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build up administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization 
*j S*e*a*t*o was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos 
But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all out war over Laos 
 some *j nations disagreed however 
 there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally unlike its more determined neighbors Thailand and South Viet Nam 
The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos 
The pro *western government which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma neutralist government never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army 
There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro *western government to the hilt 
If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma whom it felt was too trusting of Communists it gradually had to relinquish them 
One factor was the statement of Senator J W Fulbright  D  of Arkansas chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of Prince Souvanna 
Washington the White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States 
The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation 
In an important assertion of national leadership in this field he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems 
The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend 
Offenses multiply the President has also called upon the Attorney General the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem 
Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L Hackett a special assistant to the Attorney General as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime 
His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 each year showing an increase in offenders 
Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age 
East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full time director Raymond H Hawksley the present city *j head believes 
Mr Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time 
East Providence now has no civil defense program 
Mr Hawksley the state's general treasurer has been a part time *j director in the city for the last nine years 
He is not interested in being named a full time director 
Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program Mr Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full time local director 
He expressed the opinion the city could hire a *j director for about $3 500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs 
Mr Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full time *j job 
One of these men is former Fire Chief John A Laughlin he said 
Along with a director the city should provide a *j headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized 
Mr Hawksley said 
One advantage that would come to the city in having a full time director he said is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program 
Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios sirens and rescue trucks he said 
Mr Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks similar to the *j vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station 
He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area 
Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city Mr Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack 
The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point he said and a drive in theater in Seekonk would be another 
Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point 
Mr Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack 
Such vital information he said has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know 
If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full time *j director Mr Hawksley said then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally 
One of the first things he would do he said would be to organize classes in first aid 
Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government 
Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind 
Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly 
The governor's move into the so called blue law controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R Grant deputy city clerk of Central Falls 
A copy was released to the press 
Mr Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant 
The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature 
While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review Mr Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty Gen J Joseph Nugent to get the benefit of his views 
He will then appoint the study committee with Mr Nugent's cooperation the governor said 
I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings Mr Notte said to obtain the views of the general public and religious labor and special interest groups affected by these laws 
The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales 
The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws 
Should there be evidence they are shirking he has said the state police will step into the situation 
There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws 
The statutes similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath 
The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday 
The only day they have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday the council's resolution said 
The small shops must be retained for they provide essential service to the community according to the resolution which added that they also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors 
It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government 
The council advised the governor that large supermarkets factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business on Sunday 
They operate on a volume basis it was contended and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community 
Liberals and conservatives in both parties  democratic and Republican  should divorce themselves and form two independent parties George H Reama nationally known labor management expert said here yesterday 
Mr Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton *biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the welfare type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system 
He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day 
He said he was confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 
That he added was when he was a very young man a machinist and toolmaker by trade 
That was before I studied law 
Some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party 
The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track 
He steered me to the right track  the free enterprise track 
He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources 
He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties 
Mr Reama who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co in 1955 said both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product  but neither told us how to achieve it 
He said he favors wage increases for workers  but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze  and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices he added 
Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy Mr Reama said  a Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own 
Mr Reama far from really being retired is engaged in industrial relations counseling 
A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1 700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town 
William A Martinelli chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr 
The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr Martinelli happens to hold that post 
Mr Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days 
He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work 
A difference of opinion arose between Mr Martinelli and John P Bourcier town solicitor over the exact manner in which the vote is handled 
Mr Martinelli has in recent weeks been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote while Mr Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead 
Mr Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures 
He assured Mr Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible 
Mr Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement 
He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes 
After inspiring this I think we should certainly follow through on it he declared 
It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement 
He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission 
Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement he indicated and to tell them what this will mean for the town 
He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September 
Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter 
Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks it was indicated 
Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed false pretenses 
Several signers affixed their names it was learned after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system 
Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting 
Council president Frank San*antonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A Abatuno to draft the ordinance 
At the last session of the General Assembly the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective 
Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation 
At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition 
Local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense 
Plainfield  James P Mitchell and Sen Walter H Jones *j last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J Hughes Democratic gubernatorial candidate that the *j is campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism 
Mitchell was for using it Jones against and Sen Wayne Dumont Jr *j did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel 
The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club 
It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs 
Hughes said Monday it is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired 
Now he's gone the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state 
Sunday he had added we can love Eisenhower the man even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership 
Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign 
How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this 
He asked 
The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican and proud to have absorbed his philosophy while working in his adminstration 
Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue 
Regrets attack Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president 
He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign he said because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re arguing an old national campaign 
The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark 
Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary 
He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign 
State aid to schools the continuance of railroad passenger service the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority and making New Jersey attractive to new industry 
Decries joblessness Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican controlled State Senate must share the blame for this 
Noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co plant he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform 
But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time Mitchell said 
Jones unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions saved his barbs for Mitchell 
He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises 
He calls for help while saying he is against centralization but you can't have it both ways Jones said 
The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities real estate or motor vehicles he said and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue 
Defends Ike earlier Mitchell said in a statement  I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J Hughes 
His reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace loving intentions of the free nations 
I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste 
Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature 
It can only rebound to Mr Hughes' discredit 
Sees Jones ahead Sen Charles W Sandman *j May said today Jones will run well ahead of his *j opponents for the gubernatorial nomination 
Sandman state campaign chairman for Jones was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel Newark of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones 
Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years 
Sandman said  the announcement that Sen Clifford Case *j has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr Mitchell is a dead giveaway 
It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's problems 
We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington 
That failed 
We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr Mitchell some of the glow of Sen Case's candidacy of last year 
That too will fail 
Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave  Westfield as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee 
Mrs Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman 
County Supervisor Weldon R Sheets who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them 
The proposal Sheets said represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a lip service word 
Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10 year period without interest or charge 
Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January 1964 
Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines 
The candidacy of Mayor James J Sheeran of West Orange for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County was supported today by Edward W Roos West Orange public safety commissioner 
Sheeran a lawyer and former *j man is running against the Republican organization's candidate Freeholder William Mac*donald for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals 
My experience as public safety commissioner Roos said has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience and preferably one who is a lawyer 
Jim Sheeran fits that description 
Trenton  William J Seidel state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development has retired after 36 years of service 
A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore A Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state 
Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies 
In October 1944 he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section 
Under his supervision the state fire fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting 
He also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station 
He introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens 
He is credited with setting up an annual co operative fire prevention program in co operation with the Red Cross and State Department of Education 
Boonton  Richard J Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge to carry the issues to every corner of the state 
He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn  when I come back here after the November election you'll think you're my man  elected 
He said you're the kind of governor we're glad we we Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just and not what is expedient at the time 
Attacks Republicans in his only attack on the Republicans Hughes said the three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary 
But we'll have a liberal well planned forward looking honest platform 
We'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson 
We'll take the truth to the people and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November 
He said you can see signs of the Republicans' feeble attack on the Meyner administration 
But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead 
He urged New Jersey to become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy 
He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry 
We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean the former Superior Court judge said 
To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940s 
Calling the Democrats the party that lives breathes and thinks for the good of the people Hughes asked a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November 
Hughes supported Gov Meyner's Green Acres plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development 
He said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced Monday 
Conservation plan the plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state 
The other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis 
Hughes said this is not a plan to conquer space  but to conserve it pointing out the state population has increased 125 000 each year since 1950 
He said Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas there will be no land left to preserve 
Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved 
He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans 
After the primary he promised I'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong dynamic administration 
I'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican nominee 
Trenton  fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are retiring  voluntarily  this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues 
The outgoing members whose four year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary election received carved wooden elephants complete with ivory tusks to remember the state committee by 
There may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18 but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters 
A special presentation was made to Mrs Geraldine Thompson of Red Bank who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee 
She also was the original *j national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendment 
She served one four year term on the national committee 
Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R Screvane and Abraham D Beame as running mates 
At the same time reaction among anti organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable 
Some anti organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years 
The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders 
Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party 
Opposition reported some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept 7 Democratic primary 
These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city 
Their view is that last minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor 
In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate Mr Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A Buckley the Bronx Democratic leader and with Joseph T Sharkey the Brooklyn Democratic leader 
Mayor visits Buckley as usual he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine G De Sapio the Manhattan leader 
He is publicly on record as believing Mr De Sapio should be replaced for the good of the party 
Last night the Mayor visited Mr Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation 
Apparently he believes Mr Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle 
In talks with Mr Buckley last week in Washington the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E Gerosa who lives in the Bronx from this year's ticket 
But Mr Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr Gerosa's successor 
Screvane and Beame hailed the Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr Screvane who lives in Queens to replace Abe Stark the incumbent as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr Beame who lives in Brooklyn to replace Mr Gerosa as the candidate for Controller 
The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the Bronx 
After his speech reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions published in yesterday's New York Times 
The Mayor said  it didn't come from me 
But as I have said before if I announce my candidacy I will have something definite to say about running mates 
Boston June 16  a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts 
There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics 
The taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are all the same 
It's see Joe see Jim he says 
The hand is out 
A political scientist writes of the growth of alienated voters who believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt selfish and beyond popular control 
These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy the object of which is to plunder them 
Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'*connor's novel The Last Hurrah 
But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject 
A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year 
Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations 
And the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state 
A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery or worse is the norm in Massachusetts public life 
Day after day some new episode is reported 
The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent $8 555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property 
An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate 
Washington June 18  Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers 
In the Senate several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition 
In the House the Southern *republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's housing bill while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid to education bill 
The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee 
It is expected to be reported out Tuesday but this is a little uncertain 
The panel's action depends on the return of Representative James W Trimble Democrat of Arkansas who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor 
Mr Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday 
Leadership is hopeful the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans 
The Democratic leadership however hopes to pass it sometime this week 
The $6 100 000 000 measure which was passed last Monday by the Senate provides for forty year mortgages at low down payments for moderate income families 
It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories 
The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversy 
They are James J Delaney of Queens and Thomas P O'*neill Jr of Massachusetts 
Three groups to meet what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act of 1958 
This would provide for long term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private school facilities for teaching science languages and mathematics 
Mr Delaney and Mr O'*neill are not willing to vote on the public school measure until the defense education bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee 
About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups according to an official of the corps 
In the $40 000 000 budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval $26 000 000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies 
Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract negotiation stage Gordon Boyce director of relations with the voluntary agencies said in a Washington interview 
Six of these were proposed by religious groups 
They will be for teaching agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia Africa the Middle East and Latin America 
Question raised interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods means and goals 
There are a number of ways this could happen the churchmen pointed out and here is an example  last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled 
When he protested the hotel owner said  why do you worry 
The U S Government is paying for it 
The U S Government pays for all its overseas workers 
Missionary explains I don't work for the Government the American said 
I'm a missionary 
The hotel owner shrugged 
Same thing he said 
And then some churchmen remarked there is a more classical church state problem  can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state 
R Sargent Shriver Jr  director of the corps is certain that they can 
No religious group he declared in an interview will receive Peace Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes 
Moscow June 18  at a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said beaming  look he took everything I had ] Mr Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker 
Indonesia is one of the twenty under developed countries of Asia Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid 
The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations 
The Communist countries allocated more than $1 000 000 000 in economic aid alone last year according to Western estimates 
This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist program for the under developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954 
In 1960 more than 6 000 Communist technicians were present in those countries 
United Nations N Y  June 18  a committee of experts has recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations 
This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations 
One effect of the proposal which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength as in the past would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India 
India is the most populous United Nations member with more than 400 000 000 inhabitants 
The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report 
The report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the United Nations 
Formula is due this week the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is expected to receive the report this week 
The jobs formula is understood to follow these lines  each of the organization's ninety nine members would get two professional posts such as political affairs officer a department head or an economist to start 
Each member would get one post for each 10 000 000 people in its population up to 150 000 000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts 
Each member with a population above 150 000 000 would get one additional post for each additional 30 000 000 people up to an unspecified cut off point 
Geneva June 18  the three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war ridden kingdom 
The decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum Premier of the pro *western royal Government  Prince Souvanna Phouma leader of the nation's neutralists and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc and Prince Souphanouvong head of the pro *communist Pathet Lao forces 
The latter two are half brothers 
Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen nation conference on the future of Laos 
An agreement among the Princes on a coalition government would ease their task diplomats conceded 
But no one was overly optimistic 
Tactics studied in Geneva W Averell Harriman of the United States Malcolm Mac*donald of Britain Maurice Couve De Murville France's Foreign Minister and Howard C Green Canada's Minister of External Affairs concluded meanwhile a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference 
The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week 
Princess Moune Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter read the Princes' statement 
They had a two hour luncheon together in an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation she said 
The three Laotians agreed upon a six point agenda for their talks which are to last three days 
The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days 
To deal with principles the meetings in Zurich the statement said would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government

Washington  thousands of bleacher type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan 20 
Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route 
Pennsylvania Avenue named for one of the original 13 states perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint 
But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it 
Many buildings within view of the avenue are some of the United States government's tremendous buildings plus shrines and monuments 
Of course 1600 Pennsylvania the White House is the most famous address of the free world 
Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue begins a series of great federal buildings some a block long and all about seven stories high 
Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue now about 169 years old 
In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade 
They were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote 
In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time 
Seats on square along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National Archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable records are kept 
Also the department of justice building is located where J Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation 
Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania powered with lines that are underground 
Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering Lafayette Square opposite the White House 
In this historic square are several statues but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen Andrew Jackson hero of the Battle of New Orleans 
Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units 
About 16 000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade 
Division one of the parade will be the service academies 
Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas the respective states of the President and of Vice *president L B Johnson 
Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union 
Division three will be headed by the Marines followed by 12 states  division four will be headed by the Navy followed by 11 states  division five by the Air Force followed by 11 states 
Division six will be headed by the Coast Guard followed by the reserve forces of all services five states Puerto Rico the Virgin Islands Guam American Samoa the trust territories and the Canal Zone 
Jackson Miss   what does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi 
Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future 
This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants  Gov Ross Barnett 
Barnett who came into office with no previous experience in public administration has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well 
Consequently it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year 
Could be scramble some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far 
The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight year quest for the governor's office 
There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session it will really throw his administration into a scramble 
Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re enactment of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the 1960 legislative session 
If Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961 it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session 
The odds favor a special session more than likely early in the year 
Districts issue legislators always get restless for a special session  whether for the companionship or the $22 50 per diem is not certain  and if they start agitating 
Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure 
The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat 
With eyes focused on the third congressional district the historic Delta district and Congressman Frank E Smith as the one most likely to go the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature 
Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House 
Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck 
And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together 
Future clouded Barnett as the titular head of the Democratic party apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary 
With a Democratic administration party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election 
Now the picture is clouded and even *j Sens James O Eastland and John C Stennis who remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status 
Reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen 
Baton Rouge La   the Gov Jimmie H Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses 
The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue 
But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue  that of finances in state government 
The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent 
The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program 
But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over all shortage of cash than to segregation 
Legislators weary indeed the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat 
The administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant in aid program 
The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two thirds vote 
The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes 
Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy 
If it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration 
He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature 
Actually Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway 
Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so far losing battle to block token integration 
This is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly 
They would like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is something they know to be ineffectual 
Underlying concern passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition 
He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle 
Then he could tell them to go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period 
It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one 
But if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant in aid program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes 
This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration  the shortage of cash 
It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year 
If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill or any other tax bill it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma 
Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues 
Constant problem in either case it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser 
The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor 
It is one that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem 
But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature 
This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year 
A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize 
Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves 
The new year might see some house cleaning either genuine or token depending upon developments to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms 
City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had an inside track with the city 
Estimates of the city's loss in the $344 000 job have ranged as high as $200 000 
Shortcuts unnoticed Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the legitimate bids of competing contractors 
The Hughes concern then took shortcuts on the project but got paid anyway Hemphill said 
The Controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday  the city has sued for the full amount of the $172 400 performance bond covering the contract 
The Philadelphia Transportation Co is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project 
The signature of Harold V Varani former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project 
Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor 
Managing Director Donald C Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter 
The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the *j as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959 
Concern bankrupt the Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries Inc  both of 3646 N 2d St  filed for reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy law 
On Monday the Hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization 
Business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and District Attorney James C Crumlish Jr 
Intervenes in case the suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms 
Travelers Indemnity Co and the Continental Casualty Co 
At Berger's direction the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U S District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there 
I am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated Berger said 
The contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the El track 
The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints 
The city paid for work on 75 of which no more than 21 were repaired Hemphill charged 
Wide range in bids Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint 
The bid from A Belanger and Sons of Cambridge Mass  which listed the same officers as Hughes was $600 per joint 
But Hemphill added bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint 
Berger's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning press conference 
Wagner said the city paid only $37 500 to the Hughes company 
We won't know the full amount until we get a full report Wagner said 
We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond Berger said 
Wagner replied can't you just see the headline  city hooked for $172 000 
Know enough to sue Berger insisted that we know enough to sue for the full amount 
Douglas M Pratt president of the *j who attended the meeting said the transit company is reviewing the work on the El 
We want to find out who knew about it Pratt said 
Certain people must have known about it 
The *j is investigating the whole matter Pratt said 
Samuel D Goodis representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year 
Goodis voiced his objection before City Council's Finance Committee 
For hotels with 1000 rooms the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year Goodis said 
Testifies at hearing his testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses permits and city services 
The new fees are expected to raise an additional $740 000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2 330 000 more a year after that 
The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses hotels and multi family dwellings to $5 a room 
The cost of a license now is $2 with an annual renewal fee of $1 
Goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels 
Revenue estimated the city expects the higher rooming house hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457 000 a year 
The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses 
A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman Virginia Knauer who formerly raised pedigreed dogs 
The ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog 
Commissioner replies Mrs Knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal care 
In reply Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R Leary said that the city spends more than $115 000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43 000 in fees 
He reported that the city's contributions for animal care included $67 000 to the Women's S *p *c *a  $15 000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15 000 to investigate dog bites 
Backs higher fees city Finance Director Richard J Mc*connell indorsed the higher fees which he said had been under study for more than a year 
The city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees he said 
The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman and Health Commissioner Eugene A Gillis 
Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian W Barnard will be presented to the Montgomery County Court Friday it was disclosed Tuesday by Horace A Davenport counsel for the widow of the man killed last Nov 1 by Barnard's hit run car 
The petitions will be presented in open court to President Judge William F Dannehower Davenport said 
Barnard who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit run charges was fined $500 by Judge Warren K Hess and placed on two years' probation providing he does not drive during that time 
He was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning 
Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery 39 
His widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation 
The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment Authority for the purchase of land in the $300 000 000 Eastwick Redevelopment Area project 
The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project 
One of the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12 192 865 
The tract is bounded by Island Ave  Dicks Ave  61st St  and Eastwick Ave 
Four parks planned it is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment Authority's master plan and will feature row houses garden apartments four small parks schools churches a shopping center and several small clusters of stores 
The corporation was formed by the Reynolds Metal Co and the Samuel A and Henry A Berger firm a Philadelphia builder for work in the project 
The second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520 acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp  a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders which is interested in developing part of the project 
Would bar vehicles the plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr Constantinos A Doxiadis former Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp 
The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic 
It provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two and a half mile length of the project 
The esplanade eliminates Grovers Ave  which on original plans ran through the center of the development 
The esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project 
Kansas City Mo  Feb 9  U*p*i   the president of the Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work 
Battalion Chief Stanton M Gladden 42 the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union suffered multiple fractures of both ankles 
He was in Baptist Memorial hospital 
Ignition sets off blast the battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work 
I'd just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway he said 
Gladden's wife and two of his sons John 17 and Jim 13 were inside the house 
The younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall 
Hood flies over house the explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house 
The left front wheel landed 100 feet away 
Police laboratory technicians said the explosive device containing either *j or nitroglycerine was apparently placed under the left front wheel 
It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter 
Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night 
The fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union 
Led fight on teamsters Gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union's battle against the teamsters which began organizing city firemen in 1959 
The fire fighters association here offered a $5 000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing 
A $500 reward was offered by the association's local in Kansas City Kas 
The association said it would post 24 hour guards at Gladden's home and at those of James Mining and Eugene Shiflett 
Mining is secretary treasurer of the local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee 
Both have been active in the association 
Ankara Turkey Oct 24  A*p   Turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with Gen Cemal Gursel as president 
An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on Oct 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat 
By passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago the army general staff led by Gen Cedvet Sunay had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government 
The army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen Gursel as president 
Gen Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months 
The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned 
Party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own

Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically E M Martin assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night 
Martin who has been in office in Washington D C  for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel 
He told some 350 persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways following their own paths 
We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which if not identical is congenial with ours he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty 
Patience needed insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice he said was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union 
He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in and added so long as people rebel we must not give up 
Martin called for patience on the part of Americans 
The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build he said 
By leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare he said 
Individual help best we have no reason to fear failure but we must be extraordinarily patient the assistant secretary said 
Economically Martin said the United States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves 
Private business is more effective than government aid he explained because individuals are able to work with the people themselves 
The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country at what he termed a social cost 
Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country 
The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense more plans for the city's schools in event of attack 
But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go and whose advice it should follow 
The board members after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs Ralph H Molvar 1409 *j Maplecrest Dr  said they thought they had already been cooperating 
Chairman C Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem in case of atomic attack but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go 
Dr Melvin W Barnes superintendent said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership perhaps on the national level to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would be more fruitful and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district 
Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster he said 
Nobody really expects to evacuate 
I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following 
Mrs Molvar who kept reiterating her request that they please take a stand said we must have faith in somebody  on the local level and it wouldn't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children 
Dr Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans even for a high school where there were lots of cars might not be realistic and would not work 
Mrs Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program 
The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting 
It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done is going to be done and what it thought should be done

Beaverton School District No 48 board members examined blueprints and specifications for two proposed junior high schools at a Monday night workshop session 
A bond issue which would have provided some $3 5 million for construction of the two 900 student schools was defeated by district voters in January 
Last week the board by a 4 to 3 vote decided to ask voters whether they prefer the 6 3 3  junior high school  system or the 8 4 system 
Board members indicated Monday night this would be done by an advisory poll to be taken on Nov 15 the same date as a $581 000 bond election for the construction of three new elementary schools

A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the Assemblies of God in session at the Memorial Coliseum 
The council revised in an effort to strengthen the denomination's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 
The changes unanimously adopted were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible 
The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the Bible 
At the adoption the Rev T F Zimmerman general superintendent commented The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has without compromise stood for the great truths of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives 
New point added many changes involved minor editing and clarification  however the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list 
The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination now reads  the scriptures both Old and New Testament are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man the infallible authoritative rule of faith and conduct 
The third belief in six points emphasizes the Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ and   emphasizes the Virgin birth  the sinless life of Christ  his miracles  his substitutionary work on the cross  his bodily resurrection from the dead  and His exaltation to the right hand of God 
Super again elected Friday afternoon the Rev T F Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God 
His offices are in Springfield Mo 
Election came on the nominating ballot 
Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program Breakthrough scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years 
In his opening address Wednesday the Rev Mr Zimmerman urged the delegates to consider a 10 year expansion program with Breakthrough the theme for the first two years 
The Rev R L Brandt national secretary of the home missions department stressed the need for the first two years' work 
Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church 
This means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life he told delegates Friday 
Church loses pace talking of the rapid population growth  upwards of 12 000 babies born daily  with an immigrant entering the United States every 1 1/2 minutes he said our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge 
In 35 years we have opened 7 000 churches the Rev Mr Brandt said adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10 000 persons 
In this light we need 1 000 churches in Illinois where we have 200  800 in Southern New England we have 60  we need 100 in Rhode Island we have none he said 
To step up the denomination's program the Rev Mr Brandt suggested the vision of 8 000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years 
To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods he said 
Church meets change the church's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour 
A capsule view of proposed plans includes   encouraging by every means all existing Assemblies of God churches to start new churches 
  engaging mature experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers 
  surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers  laymen who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project  
  arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6 12 months as apprentices in well established churches 
U *s Dist Judge Charles L Powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud trial 
Denials were of motions of dismissal continuance mistrial separate trial acquittal striking of testimony and directed verdict 
In denying motions for dismissal Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are 
Attorney Dwight L Schwab in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide 
Proof lack charged Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the U *s mails to defraud to which federal prosecutor A Lawrence Burbank replied  it is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U *s mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy and the mails were then used to carry it out 
In the afternoon defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case 
Miami Fla  March 17  the Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major *league clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 
Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3 to o advantage 
Siebern hits homer over the first five frames Jack Fisher the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant held the *j scoreless while yielding three scattered hits 
Then Dick Hyde submarine ball hurler entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3 to 3 deadlock 
A two run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts 
House throws wild with one down in the eighth Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle 
Catcher Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt 
Then Heywood Sullivan Kansas City catcher singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run 
Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the *j fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser a wild pitch and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center 
The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers 
Three were doubles Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one 
Hartman impressive Bill Kunkel Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium 
The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth 
Hartman purchased by the *j from the Milwaukee Braves last fall allowed no hits in his scoreless three inning appearance and merited the triumph 
Keegan a 6 foot 3 inch 158 pounder gave up the Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally 
Robinson doubles again in the ninth Robinson led off with his second double of the night a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left 
Whitey Herzog performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring worked Keegan for a base on balls 
Then three consecutive pinch hitters failed to produce 
Pete Ward was sent in for House and after failing in a bunt attempt popped to Howser on the grass back of short 
John Powell batting for Adair fanned after fouling off two 2 and 2 pitches and Buddy Barker up for Stepanovich bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2 hour and 27 minute contest 
The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding along with Robinson the two Birds who got a pair of hits doubled to right center moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate 
The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out 
Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally 
Lumpe errs Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error 
Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners 
When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple he was cut down in a close play at third Tuttle to Andy Carey 
The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this  Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center 
Carey singles Carey singled on a slow bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first 
It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit 
Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play 
Breeding to Adair to Gentile setting up Tuttle's 390 foot homer over the wall in left center 
If the Orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days it will have to be at the expense of the American League champion New York Yankees who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon 
Miami Fla  March 17  the flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army's military training program and is ready for belated spring training 
Hansen who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a 255
Freshman average completes the Birds' spring squad at 49 players 
The big 22 year old shortstop the 1960 American league rookie of the year flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore signed his contract for an estimated $15 000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5 to 3 loss to Kansas City  the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row 
15 pounds lighter the 6 foot 3 inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring 
He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence 
When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox Ky  Hansen's weight had dropped to 180  too light for me to be at my best he said 
I feel good physically Hansen added but I think I'll move better carrying a little less weight than I'm carrying now 
Seeks improved fielding the rangy Albany  Cal  native a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz set improved fielding as his 1961 goal 
I think I can do a better job with the glove now that I know the hitters around the league a little better he said 
Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two game weekend series with the New York Yankees 
Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm the Flock's veteran knuckleball specialists are slated to oppose the American League champions in tomorrow's 8 P *m contest 
Duren Sheldon on hill Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon a rookie righthander who posted a 15 1 record last year for the Yanks' Auburn  N *y  farm club of the Class *d New York *pennsylvania League are the probable rival pitchers 
Twenty one year old Milt Pappas and Jerry Walker 22 are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers' Art Ditmar in Sunday's 2 P *m encounter 
Ralph Houk successor to Casey Stengel at the Yankee helm plans to bring the entire New York squad here from St Petersburg including Joe Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games 
The famed Yankee Clipper now retired has been assisting as a batting coach 
Squad cut near pitcher Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army's accelerated wintertime military course also at Fort Knox Ky 
The 22 year old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen 
Baltimore's bulky spring training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit 
Take a ride on this one Brooks Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat headed for the plate and bounced a third inning two run double off the left centerfield wall tonight 
It was the first of two doubles by Robinson who was in a mood to celebrate 
Just before game time Robinson's pretty wife Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer 
Unfortunately Brooks's teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven hit pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers 
Hansen arrived just before nightfall two hours late in company with Lee Mac*phail  J A W Iglehart chairman of the Oriole board of directors and Public Relations Director Jack Dunn 
Their flight was delayed Dunn said when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane 
Ex *oriole Clint Courtney now catching for the *j is all for the American League's 1961 expansion to the West Coast 
But they shouldda brought in Tokyo too added Old Scrapiron 
Then we'd really have someplace to go

Cleveland March 17  A*p   George Kerr the swift striding Jamaican set a meet record in the 600 yard run in the Knights of Columbus track meet tonight beating Purdue's Dave Mills in a hot duel in 1 10 1 
Kerr who set the world record earlier this month in New York with a clocking of 1 09 3 wiped out Mills's early pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter mile king by 5 yards 
Both were under the meet mark of 1 10 8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield 
Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race 
Then Kerr a graduate student from Illinois moved past him on a straightaway and held off Mills's challenge on the final turn 
Mills was timed in 1 10 4 
The crowd at the twenty first annual K of C Games final indoor meet of the season got a thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender bespectacled woman broke the one week old world record in the half mile run

While working out in Sylvania a swelling developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician 
St Petersburg Fla  March 17  A*p   two errors by New York Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5 to 2 victory to the Chicago White Sox today 
Austin Texas  a Texas halfback who doesn't even know the team's plays Eldon Moritz ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games 
Time stands still every time Moritz a 26 year old Army Signal Corps veteran goes into the field 
Although he never gets to play while the clock is running he gets a big kick  several every Saturday in fact  out of football 
Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl 
That's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries 
He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41 8 slaughter of Washington State 
Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team 
But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the quick response place kicker 
A 208 pound 6 foot 1 inch senior from Stamford Moritz practices nothing but place kicking 
Last year when he worked out at halfback all season he didn't get into a single game 
This year coach Royal told me if I'd work on my place kicking he thought he could use me said Moritz 
So I started practicing on it in spring training 
Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right  kicking  leg and as a result several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough 
Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and as a result he hopes to start practicing field goals this week 
He kicked several while playing at Stamford High School including one that beat Anson 3 0 in a 1953 district game 
I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school he said and made 26 in a row at one time 
I never did miss one in a playoff game  I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years 
Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury 
He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee then played 77 minutes in 1956 
His statistical record that year when Texas won only one game and lost nine was far from impressive  he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards 
He went into the Army in March 1957 and returned two years later 
But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season 
Place kicking is largely a matter of timing Moritz declared 
Once you get the feel of it there's not much to it 
I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feel 
Practice helps you to get your timing down 
It's kind of like golf  if you don't swing a club very often your timing gets off 
Moritz however kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session 
If you kick too much your leg gets kinda dead he explained 
Footnotes  in their first three games the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times or 40 per cent  their total passing yardage in three games 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries 
Tailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries  he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games 
Saxton has made only one second half appearance this season and that was in the Washington State game for four plays  he returned the kickoff 30 yards gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56 yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench 
Wingback Jack Collins injured a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready for Oklahoma 
Last week when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing he said  that won't last long 
It didn't  Monday he had four Longhorns in the top four 
A good feeling prevailed on the *j coaching staff Monday but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's problem  Rice University 
The Mustangs don't play this week 
We're just real happy for the players Coach Bill Meek said of the 9 7 victory over the Air Force Academy 
I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on 
It was the first time we've been ahead this season  when John Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal  
Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as a good feeling I think on the part of the coaches and the players 
We needed it and we got it 
Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon 
Both turned in top jobs for the second straight game 
Nelson played magnificent football Meek praised 
He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times 
And he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown 
He broke that boy  Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff  in two and knocked him loose from the football 
Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stages 
One was on a fourth down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory 
As soon as it started to form Gannon spotted it Meek said 
He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy  halfback Terry Isaacson  had time to turn around 
He really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss 
The Air Force's and the game's final play was a long pass by quarterback Bob Mc*naughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards 
He just lay back there and waited for it Meek said 
He almost brought it back all the way 
Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice 
Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game Meek said 
He'll be out of action all this week 
He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game 
There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee 
Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland 
He's looking a lot better and he's able to run Meek explained 
We'll let him do a lot of running this week but I don't know if he'll be able to play 
The game players saw the Air Force film Monday ran for 30 minutes then went in while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes 
We'll work hard Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday Meek said and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday 
We'll work out about an hour on Saturday then we'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week then taper off 
*j S*m*u will play the Owls at Rice Stadium in Houston in a night game Saturday Oct 21 
Huddle hearsay  held out of Texas Tech's sweat suits drill Monday at Lubbock was tackle Richard Stafford who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the Raiders' 38 7 loss to Texas *j & *j because of its important game with Arkansas coming up Saturday Baylor worked out in the rain Monday  mud or no mud 
End Gene Raesz who broke a hand in the Owl's game with *j was back working out with Rice Monday and John Nichols sophomore guard moved back into action after a week's idleness with an ankle injury 
The Texas Aggies got a day off Monday  a special gift from Coach Jim Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night but Myers announced that halfback George Hargett shaken up in the Tech game would not play against Trinity Saturday 
Halfback Bud Priddy slowed for almost a month by a slowly mending sprained ankle joined *j T*c*u's workout Monday 
The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League starts  a 19 12 triumph over the Denver Broncos  but their visit will be a short one 
The Texans have two more road games  at Buffalo and Houston  before they play for the home folks again and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre season reckonings 
Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey who has become one of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex *national Football Leaguers M C Reynolds and Warren Rabb 
Rabb the former Louisiana State field general came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22 12 upset victory over the Houston Oilers defending league champions 
Just our luck ] exclaimed Stram 
Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way 
Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star Jack Spikes though he did the team's place kicking while nursing a knee injury 
Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game 
In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job 
The Texans won the game through ball control with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes 
We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack explained Stram 
They can be going along doing little damage then bang bang  they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble 
The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off 
The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes the flashy halfback 
He was called upon 26 times  more than all of the other ball carriers combined  and delivered 145 yards 
The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson the speedy halfback hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas 
A quick touchdown resulted 
That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away said Stram quipping I think I'll put that play in the book 
The early Southwest Conference football leaders  Texas Arkansas and Texas *j & *j  made a big dent in the statistics last week 
Texas' 545 yard spree against Washington State gave the Longhorns a 3 game total offense of 1 512 yards  1 065 rushing and 447 passing  a new *j high 
Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing  on 5 completions in 7 tosses  and a tough defense to whip *j and *j & *j with a 38 point bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 
Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards 
Texas leads in per game rushing averages 355 yards and passing 149  to Baylor's 126  but idle Baylor has the best defensive record  187 5 yards per game to Texas' 189  
*j & *j has the best defense against passes 34 7 yards per game 
Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use the major leagues have ordered their own tests which are in progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis 5 3 
The husky 6 3 205 pound lefthander was in command all the way before an on the scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area 
It was Nischwitz' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning streak to four straight 
They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack 
Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning 
He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings an unusual characteristic for a southpaw 
The Bears took the lead in the first inning as they did in Sunday's opener and never lagged 
Dick Mc*auliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack 
After Al Paschal gruonded out Jay Cooke walked and Jim Mc*daniel singled home Mc*auliffe 
Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line drive to left 
Jay Porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert's smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout 
The Bears added two more in the fifth when Mc*auliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil Shartzer's glove 
Nischwitz was working on a 3 hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth 
Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infield roller accounted for the tallies 
The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert 
Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth 
Despite the 45 degree weather the game was clicked off in 1 48 thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play 
Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base 
Bingles and bobbles  Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe's eight hits 
It was the season's first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order 
The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark 
Mary Dobbs Tuttle was back at the organ 
Among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer Patti Waggin who is Mrs Don Rudolph when off the stage 
Lefty Wyman Carey another Denver rookie will be on the mound against veteran John Tsitouris at 8 o'clock Tuesday night 
Ed Donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn 
Dallas Tex  May 1   A*p   Kenny Lane of Muskegon Mich  world's seventh ranked lightweight had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler Tex  here Monday night 
St Paul *minneapolis May 1   A*p   Billy Gardner's line double which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left field drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6 5 victory over the Chicago White Sox Monday 
Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game a liner to center 
He came all the way around on Gardner's hit before 5777 fans 
It was Gardner's second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year 
Turk Lown was tagged with the loss his second against no victories while Ray Moore won his second game against a single loss 
The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green's double to left 
The White Sox had taken a 5 4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits  a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon  a walk and a sacrifice fly 
Jim Landis' 380 foot home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1 0 lead but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard 
Al Smith's 340 blast over left in the fourth  his fourth homer of the campaign  tied the score and Carreon's first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front 
A double by Green Allison's run scoring 2 baser an infield single by Lemon and Gardner's solid single to center put the Twins back in front in the last of the fifth 
Ogden Utah May 1   A*p   Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball 
I've had it he told a newsman 
I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club 
This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout 
Jensen got only six hits in 46 at bats for a 130
Batting average in the first 12 games 
He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday without an official word to anybody and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno Nev  where his wife former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen awaited 
She said when she learned Jackie was heading home  I'm just speculating but I have to think Jack feels he's hurting Boston's chances 
The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner City of San Francisco stopped in Ogden Utah for a few minutes 
Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him 
The conductor said to Ritchie  I don't think you want to talk to him 
You'll probably get a ball bat on the head 
He's mad at the world 
But Jackie had gone into the station 
Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand 
I told him who I was and he was quite cold 
But he warmed up after a while 
I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double crosser and said anything he  Liston  got was through a keyhole 
He said he had never talked to Liston 
Liston is Bill Liston baseball writer for the Boston Traveler who quoted Jensen as saying  I can't hit anymore 
I can't run 
I can't throw 
Suddenly my reflexes are gone 
Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging 
And so it was over the weekend what with 40 year old Warren Spahn pitching his no hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating with a record tying 4 homer spree Sunday 
Both of course were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime 
Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts 
It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2 score year milestone 
And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked wish I was 40 and a top grade big leaguer 
The modest and happy Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days 
But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all time great lefthanders in the game's history 
Yes with Bob Grove Carl Hubbell Herb Pennock Art Nehf Vernon Gomez et al 
Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow a ball player's ball player as they say in the trade 
I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct 14 1951 before a new record crowd for the period of 18 792 
Spahnie doesn't know how to merely go through the motions remarked Enos Slaughter another all out guy who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse 
The spectacular Mays who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings 
Incidentally only two did it before a home audience 
Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field 
Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies the Braves' Joe Adcock Lou Gehrig of the Yankees Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito then with Cleveland made their history on the road 
Willie's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle 
This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion depending on whether you're an American or National fan and anti or pro *yankee 
The record books however would favor the Giants' ace 
In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases 
Once the figure was 30 30 
Willie's lifetime batting average of 318
Is 11 points beyond Mickey's 
The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's park 
It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump 
The Denver area *j audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home 
This rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulers 
The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the Living Room Athletic Club when games were cut off 
Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy 
This year I am told the *j network will continue to abide by the rule but *j will play to a conclusion here 
There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise 
It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good especially at the minor league level 
You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy 
This dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game 
Cincinnati Ohio  A*p   the powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5 game romp over outclassed Cincinnati crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13 5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale 
With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries the American League champs still mounted a 15 hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers the most ever used by one team in a series game 
Johnny Blanchard Mantle's replacement slammed a 2 run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5 run first inning 
Hector Lopez subbing for Berra smashed a 3 run homer off Bill Henry during another 5 run explosion in the fourth 
The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors 
The crowd of 32 589 had only two chances to applaud 
In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center about 400 feet away with two men on 
Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game trailing only 6 3 but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out 
In the fifth Wally Post slashed a 2 run homer off Bud Daley but by that time the score was 11 5 and it really didn't matter 
The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager 
Only Bucky Harris the boy manager of Washington in 1924 and Eddie Dyer of the St Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat 
Philadelphia Jan 23  Nick Skorich the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles was elevated today to head coach 
Skorich received a three year contract at a salary believed to be between $20 000 and $25 000 a year 
He succeeds Buck Shaw who retired at the end of last season 
The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw's staff  Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer 
Williams is a defensive coach 
Gauer works with the ends 
Choice was expected the selection had been expected 
Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings the newest National Football League entry 
Van Brocklin the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday 
Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player 
With Skorich at the helm the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running rather than passing 
In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials 
Skorich however is a strong advocate of a balanced attack  split between running and passing 
Coach played 3 years Skorich who is 39 years old played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers 
An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season 
He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949 
He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy N Y 
He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach 
Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers 
The Eagles signed him for Shaw's staff in 1959 
Skorich began his new job auspiciously today 
At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth the Eagles were honored for winning the championship 
Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football 
With the announcement of a special achievement award to William A  Bill  Shea the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night's thirty eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter Baseball Writers' Association of America at the Waldorf *astoria Hotel 
Shea the chairman of Mayor Wagner's Baseball Committee will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves  Frank Graham the Journal *american sports columnist  Bill Mazeroski the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Casey Stengel the former manager of the Yankees 
Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award 
Mazeroski whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series 
Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William J Slocum Memorial Award 
To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter's player of the year 
Show follows ceremonies a crowd of 1 400 is expected for the ceremonies which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit dance and song 
The 53 year old Shea a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York 
Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A Farley Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume Shea worked relentlessly 
His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city 
The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees 
Despite countless barriers and disappointments Shea moved forward 
When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion he sought to convince another National League club to move here 
When that failed he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league the Continental with New York as the key franchise 
The Continental League never got off the ground but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand 
Flushing stadium in works the New York franchise is headed by Mrs Charles Shipman Payson 
A big league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C Frick 
Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium 
Shea and his wife Nori make their home at Sands Point L I 
Bill Jr  20 Kathy 15 and Patricia 9 round out the Shea family 
Shea was born in Manhattan 
He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington 
He played basketball there while working toward a law degree 
Later Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians a minor league professional football team 
He was the lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League 
All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday 
On Friday Roger Maris the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most valuable player award will meet with Roy Hamey the general manager 
Maris is in line for a big raise 
Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight 
The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre 
Palmer golf's leading money winner in 1960 and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin 
Deane Beman the National Amateur champion and all the metropolitan district champions including Bob Gardner the amateur title holder also will receive awards 
The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John Mc*auliffe of Plainfield N J  and Palm Beach Fla  for his sponsorship of charity tournaments 
Horton Smith of Detroit a former president of the Professional Golfers Association will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback following a recent illness 
The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington Democrat of Missouri 
Golf's golden boy Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months 
He won the Masters the United States Open and a record $80 738 in prize money 
He was heralded as Sportsman of the Year by Sports Illustrated and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the Professional Athlete of the Year a distinction that earned for him the $10 000 diamond studded Hickok Belt 
But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot 
A couple of weeks ago he scored a monstrous 12 on a par 5 hole 
It made him human 
And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair 
If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege there was hope left for all 
It was neither a spirit of self sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold 
He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all 
The world's best golfer shooting below par came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher 
He boomed a 280 yard drive 
Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance 
No margin for error on the narrow fairway of a 508 yard hole Arnold whipped into his second shot 
The ball went off in a majestic arc an out of bounds slice 
He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds 
He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side 
It is possible that I over corrected he said ruefully 
Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes 
So he wound up with a dozen 
It was a nice round figure that 12 he said as he headed for the clubhouse not too much perturbed 
From the standpoint of the army of duffers however this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open 
The idol of the hackers of course is Ray Ainsley who achieved a 19 in the United States Open 
Their secondary hero is another pro Willie Chisholm who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock strewn gully 
Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes who tried to keep count 
Stickler for rules how many is that Jim 
Asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project 
Thirteen said Long Jim 
Nae man said Willie ye must be countin' the echoes 
He had a 16 
Palmer's dozen were honestly earned 
Nor were there any rules to save him 
If there had been he would have found a loophole because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book 
This knowledge has come in handy too 
His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway 
The ball floated downstream 
A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie 
Arnold sent for Joe Dey the executive secretary of the golf association 
Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream 
I knew it all along confessed Arnold with a grin but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there 
For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings 
Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors 
He'll even bull head on into the rules when he is sure he's right 
That's how he first won the Masters in 1958 
It happened on the twelfth hole a 155 yarder 
Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains thereby bringing local rules into force 
Ruling from on high I can remove the ball can't I 
Asked Palmer of an official 
No said the official 
You must play it where it lies 
You're wrong said Arnold a man who knows the rules 
I'll do as you say but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling 
He scored a 4 for the embedded ball a 3 with the provisional one 
The golfing fathers ruled in his favor 
So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke 
Until a few weeks ago however Arnold Palmer was some god like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers 
But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys a bigger hero than he ever had been before 
A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today 
Other items on the agenda during the meetings which are expected to continue through Saturday concern television rules changes professional football's hall of fame players' benefits and constitutional amendments 
The owners would like each club in the fourteen team league to play a home and home series with teams in its division plus two games against teams in the other division 
However this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks 
Pete Rozelle the league commissioner pointed out  we'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other 
Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early season conflict in dates 
If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower start this season 
Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat Mauch said here the other day 
The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year 
They have the same men no age problem no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season along with Bobby Shantz 
Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 breaking even with them will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions 
The Pirates have a 9 6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7 9 
Change in pitchers 
Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio for several reasons  1 Broglio's 4 0 won lost record and 1 24 earned run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago  2 the desire to give Broglio as many starts possible  3 the Redbirds' disheartening 11 7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday 
Manager Hemus eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment 
After Thursday's open date Solly plans to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night 
Harvey Haddix set back by the flu this season will start against his former Cardinal mates who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight's game at Busch Stadium 
Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck 
Haddix has a 13 8 record against the Redbirds despite only a 1 3 mark in 1960 
Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he hadn't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's game 
Mizell has won both of his starts 
Nieman kept in lineup 
After a lengthy workout yesterday an open date Hemus said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup 
That means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five home run day against the Giants 
I have to stay with Nieman for a while Hemus said 
Bill White  sore ankles  should be ready 
With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh I may use Don Taussig in center 
Lindy Mc*daniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes and he looked good Hemus said 
He should be getting back in the groove before long 
Our pitching is much better than it has shown 
The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday 
Six Bucks over 300
 
Until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati over the weekend the champions had eight men hitting over 300
 
Despite the recession Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages  Smoky Burgess 455
 Gino Cimoli 389
 Bill Virdon 340
 Bob Clemente and Dick Groat each 323
 Dick Stuart 306
 Don Hoak 280
And Bob Skinner 267
 
Bill Mazeroski with 179
And Hal Smith with 143
Were the only Pirates dragging their feet 
Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home runs 
Friend is off to a great start with a 4 0 record but isn't likely to see action here this week 
We're getting Friend some runs for a change and he has been pitching good Murtaugh said 
Virdon has been blasting the ball 
No plunkers for him 
Six Bucs over 300
 
The Pirates jumped off to an 11 3 start by May 1 last year when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them even over the season 
On last May 1 the Cardinals stood at 7 6 ending a two season fall off on that milestone 
In 1958 the Birds were 3 10 on May 1 
A year later they were 4 13 
Since 1949 the St Louis club has been below 500
On May 1 just four times 
The '49 team was off to a so so 5 5 beginning then fell as low as 12 17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories 
The '52 Cards were 6 7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs the club's top since 1949 
Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11 18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories 
Since 1949 the only National League club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team 
Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21 2 mark and a nine game lead by May 8 
The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New York's '51 Giants who dropped 11 of their first 13 
They honored the battling Billikens last night 
Speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St Louis University players who in the words of Coach John Benington had more confidence in themselves than I did 
The most valuable player award was split three ways among Glen Mankowski Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer 
In addition a special award was given to Bob  Bevo  Nordmann the 6 foot 10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury 
You often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies but what this team had was a little different 
The boys had a tremendous respect for each other's ability 
They knew what they could do and it was often a little more than I thought they could do 
Several times I found the players pepping me up where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk 
We'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say don't worry Coach  we'll get 'em all right 
The trio who shared the most valuable honors were introduced by Bob Broeg sports editor of the Post *dispatch 
Kieffer the only junior in the group was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch as well as his all round excellent play 
Mankowski the ball hawking defensive expert was cited for his performance against Bradley in St Louis U 's nationally televised victory 
Benington said I've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day 
Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills 
After the coach listed all the boy's faults Hartweger said Coach before I leave here you'll get to like me 
Mrs Benington admired Gordon's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team 
As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl he said I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting me play 
Bob Burnes sports editor of the Globe *democrat presented Bob Nordmann with his award 
Bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time 
Within a week after the injury suffered in St Louis's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament Nordmann was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could to help Benington 
On the clock given him was the inscription For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball 1960 61 
Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21 9 record and finished as runner up in the National Invitation Tournament were  Art Hambric Donnell Reid Bill Nordmann Dave Harris Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich 
This team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future Benington pointed out 
By winning against Bradley Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams' home courts they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn't take a super team to do it 
St Louis University found a way to win a baseball game 
Larry Scherer last night pitched a no hit game said to be the first in Billiken baseball history as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State College 5 1 at Crystal City 
The victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie 
The tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday 
Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double Len Boehmer also was 4 for 5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a home run and a triple 
St Louis U was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University at Ligget Field 
The game opened a busy week for Washington 
The Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at 3 30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy Ill  Saturday 
Happy hitting if it's true that contented cows give more milk why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits 
The two top talents of the time Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which to be frank about it never have quite reached expectations 
And that's meant as a boost not a knock 
Mays and Mantle both 10 year men at 30 have so much ability that baseball men agree they've never hit the heights 
Their heights that is 
Mantle the bull necked blond switch hitter had one sensational triple crown season 1959 when he batted 365
And also led the American League in home runs 52 and rbi's 130 
Like the Yankees' slugger Mays the terror of the Giants has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players but not by  or for  Willie 
His best years were 1954 when he hit 345
With 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs drove in 127 and stole 24 bases 
Now apparently happier under new managers Mays and Mantle the perfect players are behaving as though they're going to pass those previous peaks 
Labor relations yes we know they're professionals men paid to play and they shouldn't care how they're handled just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month 
The truth is though that men react differently to different treatment 
For that matter Stan Musial is rare possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers reserving his opinions but not his effort 
Mantle it's apparent resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility 
The old man was almost too possessive 
Stengel inherited Di*maggio Rizzuto but he brought up Mantle from Class *j to the majors from Joplin to New York 
With the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him Ol' Case wanted No 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter but also the best bunter base runner and outfielder 
Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats 
Inheriting a more mature Mantle who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway Ralph Houk quietly bestowed no pun intended the mantle of authority on Mickey 
The Major decided that rather than be led the slugger could lead 
And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so far 
The opinion continues here that with a 162 game schedule pitching spread thin through a 10 team league and a most inviting target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr  Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books Babe Ruth's 60 homers of 1927 
Four for Alvin Mays' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year 
Willie's wonderful walloping Sunday  four home runs  served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark 
Next to Leo Durocher Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass green rookie rushed up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant

Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset at the Salvation Army's Social Center at 1200 Larimer St 
The pert gray haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo N *y  is a civilian with the Army 
Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director 
The job also covers a number of other items 
Mom Marr as the more than 80 men at the center call her is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society 
Her day starts early but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written  and during May which is National Salvation Army Week there are plenty  schedules to be made or problems to be solved Mrs Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is out 
Mrs Marr is the first contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up 
She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures 
Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men Mrs Marr explained 
The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center 
And I bum tickets to everything I can she said 
I've become the greatest beggar in the world 
In addition to the tickets to the movies sporting events and concerts Mrs Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system 
Mrs Marr also has a number of parolees to mother watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society 
By mid *june millions of Americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land 
In another four weeks with schools closed across the nation the great all *american summer safari will be under way 
By July 1 six weeks from now motel keepers all over the nation will by 6 p m  be switching on that bleak  to motorists  sign No Vacancy 
No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car throw suitcases kids and comic books in the back seat and head for home 
And where is home that magic place of the heart 
Ah that is simple 
Home is where a man was born reared went to school and most particularly where grandma is 
That is where we turn in the good old summertime 
The land lies ready for the coming onslaught 
My husband and I a month ahead of the rush have just finished a 7 day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson Ariz  to New York City  set for influx I can testify that motels service and comfort stations  they go together like Scots and heather  dog wagons roadside restaurants souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting 
I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent far flung over night accommodations 
Maybe motel keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry but it certainly looks that way from the highway 
There are motels for all purposes and all tastes 
There are even motels for local weather peculiarities in Shamrock Tex  as I discovered 
There the Royal Motel advertises all facilities vented heat air conditioned carpeted free *j storm cellar

Some even boast two pools one for adults and one for children 
But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar 
Motorists like myself who can remember the old tourists accommodated signs on farm houses and village homes before World War 2 can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast grossing motel business 
All for $14 ] at the Boxwood Motel in Winchester Va  we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite an elegant affair with wall to wall carpeting gold and white furniture pink satin brocade chairs 24 inch *j and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay offs effective at 12 01 A *m next Saturday 
The current monthly payroll comes to about $15 000 000 
Howard E Simpson the railroad's president said a drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action 
The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B & O operates 
Salary cut and lay offs it will be accomplished in two ways  1 a flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions 
There are about 3 325 officers and employees in this class 
2 sufficient lay offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense 
Since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough a B & O spokesman said 
Those union members kept on their jobs therefore will not take a cut in their wages 
The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job

Automatic entered the taxi at Pennsylvania Avenue and Gold Street

Annapolis Jan 7  the Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what 
The proposal was made by Dr David S Jenkins after he and Mrs D Ellwood Williams Jr  a board member and long time critic of the superintendent argued for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting 
The disagreement was over what Dr Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting 
Cites discrepancies Mrs Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for the board's approval 
I hate to have these things come up again and again Dr Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion 
These are the board's minutes 
I'll write what you tell me to 
For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago 
It was about that time a board member said later that Dr Thomas G Pullen Jr  State superintendent of schools told Dr Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him 
The Board of County Commissioners the Sanitary Commission the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings 
Dr Jenkins notes however that most of the school boards in the State do not do so

The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday that there are deficiencies in the city's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible 
Councilman William D Schaefer  D  Fifth  said in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month 
Werner criticized conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm Mr Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here 
He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December 
Equipment should be in operation almost immediately after the first snowfall Mr Schaefer said 
The Councilman who is the Administration floor leader also criticized Bernard L Werner public works director for halting snow operations on Tuesday night after the Sunday storm 
Sent home for rest Mr Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week 
What he did Mr Werner said was let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some rest 
Work resumed Wednesday he said 
Mr Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them should be strictly enforced 
Admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive 
Recounting personal observations of clearance work the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes 
Annapolis Jan 7  special   the 15 year old adopted son of a Washington attorney and his wife who were murdered early today in their Chesapeake Bay front home has been sent to Spring Grove State Hospital for detention

Maryland contracts for future construction during October totaled $77 389 000 up to 10 per cent compared to October 1960 F W Dodge Dodge Corporation reported 
Dodge reported the following breakdown  nonresidential at $20 447 000 down 28 per cent  residential at $47 101 000 up 100 per cent  and heavy engineering at $9 841 000 down 45 per cent 
The cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634 517 000 a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year 
A breakdown of the ten month total showed  nonresidential at $253 355 000 up 22 per cent  residential at $278 877 000 up 12 per cent  and heavy engineering at $102 285 000 down 33 per cent 
Residential building consists of houses apartments hotels dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter 
The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments which began about six years ago has more than tripled within that span of time 
In 1961 it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction 
While availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment building field 
Although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments Leo J Pantas vice president of a hardware manufacturing company pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common  a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house 
Convenience held key convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today 
Trouble free long life quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 Pantas predicted 
Sixty seven living units are being added to the 165 unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section 
Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units in two story and three story structures 
Various of the apartments are of the terrace type being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct 
Others which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs have balconies 
The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction 
Heating is by individual gas fired forced warm air systems 
Construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product according to a study by Johns *manville Corporation 
London Feb 9  vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine the Dreadnought and by implication of the entire United States navy's still building nuclear sub fleet were stolen by a London based soviet spy ring secret service agents testified today 
The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year 
It is a killer sub  that is a hunter of enemy subs 
It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus the world's first atomic submarine 
Its power unit however was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack 
Five held for trial the announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St police court here at the end of a three day hearing 
A full trial was ordered for  two British civil servants Miss Ethel Gee 46 and her newly devoted friend Harry Houghton 55 and divorced 
They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard 
Gordon A Lonsdale 37 a mystery man presumed to be Russian although he carries a Canadian passport 
When arrested he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping it was testified 
Flashed to Moscow a shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger bookseller and wife Joyce 
 in Washington the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen an American couple formerly of New York City  
In their suburban cottage the crown charges the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man usually on the first Saturday evening of each month and spent much of the week end getting the secrets off to Moscow either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books 
Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing a printed page or a manuscript 
All five pleaded innocent 
Only Miss Gee asked for bail 
Her young British lawyer James Dunlop pleaded that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother 80 her maiden aunt also 80 and bedridden for 20 years and her uncle 76 who once ran a candy shop 
Refuses to grant bail I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them said the magistrate K *j *p Baraclough 
The trial will be held probably the first week of March in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s was sentenced to 14 years in prison 
Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five who may have altered history in the 1960s 
Fuchs after nine and a half years was released being given time off for good behavior 
He promptly went to communist East Germany 
The magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29 000 in American and British currency mostly $20 bills and in British government bonds and stocks 
This is Russian money said Mervin Griffith *jones for the attorney general's office 
He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow Lonsdale the Red paymaster and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets 
Of highest value the fact that secrets of the Dreadnought and thereby of the American undersea fleet were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier 
But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare Capt George Symonds 
He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon Jan 7 
The information he said would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy 
Court cleared just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring watched for six months was broken remained untold 
The British defending lawyers who today increased from three to four demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury the chances of their clients would improve 
So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour 
Almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet 
Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed 
The United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack 
With the machinery went a complete design for the hull 
The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it 
Navy's future involved much of the navy's future depends upon her an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August 1959 for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station 
It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work 
Her basic hull form  a teardrop  and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines including the potent Polaris missile submarines the statement went on 
The atom reactor water cooled was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp 
Thru development the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size and also in complexity allowing a single propeller to be used the navy said 
The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work 
It was first tried out on a conventional submarine the Albacore in 1954 
The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built 
Reputedly it could outrun underwater the fastest destroyers 
It could reputedly go 70 000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month 
It was of the hunter killer type designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes 
The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee's purse would if completed and handed back have given the Kremlin a complete picture of our current anti submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future 
Interested in detector the spy ring also was particularly interested in *j the underwater equipment for detecting submarines it was testified 
Range was a vital detail 
Designs of parts were sought 
Six radiomen told how twice on two days after the ring was nabbed a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling using signals times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid 
Oddly the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested 
The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives is the product of rumor combined with malice and individual enmity on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court 
The three  Miles J Cooperman Sheldon Teller and Richard Austin  and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws 
In his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men Bernard H Sokol attorney for the detectives said that evidence would show that his clients were entirely innocent 
Had to know peddlers when they became members of the city police narcotics unit Sokol said they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket 
They on occasion posed as addicts and peddlers 
Although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together Sokol continued rivalries developed when they were aiming at the same criminals 
This he added brought about petty jealousies and petty personal grievances 
In the same five year period that the United States says they  the detectives  were engaged in this conspiracy Sokol continued these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal 
No comments by U *s in opening D Arthur Connelly assistant United States attorney read the indictment but made no comments 
Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients' guilt 
Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4 700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler Otis Sears 45 of 6934 Indiana Av 
Among other acts Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears 
The first witness Moses Winston Mardis 5835 Michigan Av  a real estate agent and former bail bondsman took the stand after opening statements had been made 
But court adjourned after he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings two of the defendants and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted 
Buaford Robinson 23 of 7026 Stewart Av  a *j bus driver was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st Street and South Park Way 
Robinson was treated at a physician's office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee 
His losses included his money bag containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck 
Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan Lloyd of the Wabash Avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational High School 30th Street and South Park Way and began skylarking 
When 51st Street was reached Robinson related he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the *j supervisor 
As he left the bus with his money bag Robinson added the largest youth accosted him a quarrel ensued and the youth knocked him down 
Then the youths fled with his money 
Mrs Blanche Dunkel 60 who has spent 25 years in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son in law Ervin Lang then 28 appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois pardon and parole board members John M Bookwalter and Joseph Carpentier 
She had been sentenced to 180 years in prison but former Gov Stratton commuted her term to 75 years making her eligible for parole as one of his last acts in office 
Mrs Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son in law became her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934 
It was when he attempted to end the relationship that the murder took place 
The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $100 yesterday and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan 20

The car spun around again Simms said before Stickney could turn north in Prairie Avenue and then violated two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie 
St Johns Mich  April 19 
  a jury of seven men and five women found 21 year old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs Anna Hengesbach 
Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion 
He returned to his cell in the county jail where he has been held since his arrest last July without a word to his court appointed attorney Jack Walker or his guard 
Stepson vindicated the verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's stepson Vincent Hengesbach 54 who was tried for the same crime in December 1958 and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict 
Mrs Hengesbach was killed on Aug 31 1958 
Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since 
When the verdict came in against his young neighbor Hengesbach said  I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed 
Still I don't wish to appear happy at somebody else's misfortune 
Lives on welfare Hengesbach who has been living on welfare recently said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in Westphalia 27 miles southwest of here 
Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 
Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area by State Police 
He also admitted killing Mrs Hengesbach 
However the confession which was the only evidence against him was retracted before the trial 
Charges in doubt assistant Prosecutor Fred Lewis who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against Pohl 
Circuit Judge Paul R Cash did not set a date for sentencing 
Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation 
Walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure 
Locked in motel a verdict against Pohl came at 05 p m after almost 13 1/2 hours of deliberation 
The jury which was locked up in a motel overnight was canvassed at the request of Walker after the verdict was announced 
The jury foreman Mrs Olive Heideman of rural Elsie said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence 
She said the jurors agreed that Pohl's confession was valid 
The jury asked Judge Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second degree murder and manslaughter 
The verdict came three hours later 
Some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read 
The trial had packed the large courtroom for more than a week 
A Sterling Township family of six surviving children whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one of the children found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends 
While neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother's duties fund raising events were being planned by a homeowners association and a student council for the hard hit Henry Kowalski family 34220 Viceroy 
Mrs Eleanor Kowalski 42 died yesterday afternoon in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night at the flat of her widowed mother Mrs Mary Pankowski in the adjoining suburb of Warren 
Services tomorrow funeral services for Mrs Kowalski and her daughter Christine 11 who died of burns at the same hospital Monday have been scheduled for 10 a m tomorrow in St Anne's Catholic Church 31978 Mound in Warren 
The mother and daughter who will be buried side by side in Mt Olivet Cemetery rested together today in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott Funeral Home 31730 Mound Warren 
Mrs Pankowski 61 remained in Holy Cross Hospital as a result of the explosion which occurred while Mrs Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother's small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile Road East 
Held candle assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski girls present held for her mother because the flat lacked electricity 
Christine's twin sister Patricia and Darlene Kowalski 8 escaped with minor burns 
They are home now with the other Kowalski children Vicky 14  Dennis 6  Eleanor 2  and Bernardine 1 
All we have left in the world is one another and we must stay together the way Mother wanted Kowalski said in telling his children of their mother's death yesterday afternoon 
Kowalski a roofer who seldom worked last winter already was in arrears on their recently purchased split level home when the tragedy staggered him with medical and funeral bills 
$135 donated neighbor women such as Mrs Sidney Baker 2269 Serra Sterling Township have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with Kowalski's sister in law Mrs Anna Kowalski 22111 David East Detroit 
Another neighbor Mrs Frank C Smith 2731 Pall Mall Sterling Township surprised Kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the $400 funeral costs 
John C Houghton president of the Tareytown Acres Homeowners Association followed that by announcing plans last night for a door to door fund drive throughout their subdivision on behalf of the Kowalski family 
Students help out Houghton said 6 p m Friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes in the subdivision which is located northeast of Dequindre and 14 Mile Road East 
He said contributions also could be mailed to Post Office Box 553 Warren Village Station 
Vicky Kowalski meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost $25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann Junior High School 5155 Fourteen Mile road east 
Principal Clayton W Pohly said he would allow a further collection between classes today and revealed that *j Club past surpluses had been used to provide a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs Kowalski 
Funds from dances student Council officers announced today the Kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from a school dance held two weeks ago and another dance for Fuhrmann's 770 students this Friday night 
Furhmann's faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort started largely among the students themselves because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for her entire family Pohly said 
There also were reports of a collection at the County Line Elementary School 3505o Dequindre which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including Christine 
Expresses thanks Kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last Saturday 
But today he wanted to make a public statement 
I never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family 
I wasn't sure there were such people anywhere in the world 
I'll need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them 
An alert 10 year old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against a youthful motorist 
Patrolman George Kimmell of Mc*clellan Station said he would recommend a special safety citation for Ralph Sisk 9230 Vernor east a third grader at the Scripps School for his assistance in the case 
Kimmell said he and Ralph were helping children across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon when a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly inside the pedestrian crosswalk 
Gets car number Kimmell ordered the driver to back up watched the children safely across and was approaching the car when it suddenly took off at high speed he said narrowly missing him 
Commandeering a passing car Kimmell pursued the fleeing vehicle but lost it in traffic 
Returning to the school crossing the officer was informed by the Sisk boy that he recognized the driver a neighbor and had obtained the license number 
The motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees 17 of 2433 Mc*clellan currently on probation and under court order not to drive 
Given 15 days he was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday by Traffic Judge George T Murphy who continued his no driving probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the Detroit House of Correction

The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today 
Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union to agree tomorrow to an immediate cease fire 
Help asked in Vientiane the royal Laotian government decided today to ask its friends and neighbors for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive threatening the southeast Asian kingdom 
Britain's plans to press Russia for a definite cease fire timetable was announced in London by Foreign Secretary Lord Home 
He said Britain also proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened sent to New Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease fire 
A 14 power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5 he said 
Plea for arms the Laos government plea for help was made by Foreign Minister Tiao Sopsaisana 
He indicated that requests would be made for more U *s arms and more U *s military advisers 
He declared the government is thinking of asking for foreign troops if the situation worsens 
One of the first moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the United States to establish a full fledged military assistance group instead of the current civilian body 
A note making the request was handed to U *s Ambassador Winthrop G Brown 
Heavy support the Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel attacks had been launched heavily supported by troops from Communist North Viet Nam 
The minister describing the attacks which led up to the appeal said that 60 000 Communist North Vietnamese were fighting royal army troops on one front  near Thakhek in southern central Laos 
There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources 
In the past such government claims have been found exaggerated 
Havana April 19 
  two Americans and seven Cubans were executed by firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began decreeing the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators 
A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans as Howard Anderson and August Jack Mc*nair 
The executions took place at dawn only a few hours after Havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at Pinar Del Rio where the executions took place 
Arms plot charged the broadcast said Anderson a Seattle ex marine and Havana businessman and Mc*nair of Miami were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels

Emory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible 
Emory University's charter and by laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race board chairman Henry L Bowden stated 
But an official statement adopted by the 33 man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes 
The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law tax exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated 
Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning of true university grade and meet its financial obligations without the tax exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions the statement said 
The statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation 
An Emory spokesman indicated however that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws 
The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if among other criteria all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people 
At least two private colleges in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies but their tax exempt status never has been challenged by the state 
Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church 
Some church leaders both clerical and lay have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation 
Urged in 1954 the student newspaper The Emory Wheel as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation 
From its beginning the trustees' statement said Friday Emory University has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning 
Teaching research and study according to highest standards under Christian influence are paramount in the Emory University policy 
As a private institution supported by generous individuals Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian education 
There is not now nor has there ever been in Emory University's charter or by laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race color or creed 
Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned Emory University could now consider applications from prospective students and others seeking applications from prospective students and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university irrespective of race color or creed 
Corporate existence on the other hand Emory University derives its corporate existence from the State of Georgia 
When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the University without regard to race color or creed continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian higher education 
A young man was killed and two others injured at midnight Friday when the car they were riding slid into a utility pole on Lake Avenue near Waddell Street *j police said

The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration Friday and threatened picketing and stand ins if negotiations failed 
The demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of first run theaters by the Committee on Appeal for Human Rights 
Intend to attend we intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year the identically worded letters said 
The letters set a Nov 15 deadline for the start of negotiations 
They indicated that stand ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate 
Downtown and art theater managers and owners contacted Friday night for comment on the *j request said they had no knowledge of such a letter and that it was not in the Friday mail 
However three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend 
Gather here the *j letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here Sunday 
Several theater operators said however that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three day affair 
Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago 
Charles A Black *j chairman said Friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on Oct 31 but had failed to show up 
He declined to name the three 
Friday's letters asked for a Nov 15 meeting 
Failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend the letters said would be considered a sign of indifference 
Black said *j hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal a prepared statement released by the student group Friday stated that extensive research by *j into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits besides managers of downtown theaters the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and Buckhead

Salem  special   for a second month in a row Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need the state public welfare commission was told Friday 
It is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in *j category for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary 
William Smythe director of field service told the commissioners that Multnomah as of Aug 22 had spent $58 918 out of its budgeted $66 000 in the category leaving only $7 082 for the rest of the month 
At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month this could mean a shortage of as high as $17 000 
But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month Smythe said 
No request for emergency allotment had yet been received however 
Board oks pact the commission meeting for the first time with both of its newly appointed commissioners Roy Webster of Hood River and Dr Ennis Keizer of North Bend approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past 
The contract with Ray Field who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month 
Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes 
Acting Administrator Andrew F Juras said that because of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period 
But he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles and he said he personally regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past 
He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave 
Salary termed modest Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government 
He also said that the salary in terms of going rates in the field was modest in terms of the man's responsibility 
The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed he said and added Field's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program 
Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract 
Asked Mrs Grace O Peck representative from Multnomah County of the commission chairman Joseph E Harvey Jr 
My feeling at the moment he said is that we have no alternative irrespective of some of the arguments about him 
The continued operation of this program depends on having his service 
Harvey criticized Mrs Peck later joined by the commission's vice chairman Mrs Lee Patterson took Harvey to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club Tuesday 
A publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service of which Harvey is president quoted him as saying the welfare office move to Salem instead of crippling the agency had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses with the key being improved communications between *j & *j and the commission staff 
I rather resent she said you speaking to those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this 
I think you fell short of the real truth in the matter  that the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people 
The staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles 
Harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare

Birmingham Ala    A*p   the *j yesterday arrested on a perjury charge one of the members of the jury that failed to reach a verdict in the Freedom Rider bus burning trial four weeks ago 
U *s Attorney Macon Weaver said the federal complaint charged that the juror gave false information when asked about Ku Klux Klan membership during selection of jury 
He identified the man as Lewis Martin Parker 59 a farmer of Hartselle Ala 
Eight men were tried together in U *s District Court in Anniston Ala  on charges of interfering with interstate transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white mob's attack on a Greyhound bus carrying the first of the Freedom Riders 
The bus was burned outside Anniston 
One of the eight defendants was freed on a directed verdict of acquittal 
A mistrial was declared in the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict 
The arrest of Mr Parker marks the third charge of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case 
The first incident occurred before the trial got under way when Judge H Hobart Grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury tampering efforts 
He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone outside the court had spoken to them about the case 
Two members of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial 
Neither was seated on the jury 
Then when the case went to the jury the judge excused one of the jurors saying the juror had told him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the trial opened

Asilomar March 26 vast spraying programs conducted by technicians with narrow training and little wisdom are endangering crops and wildlife Carl W Buchheister president of the National Audubon Society said today 
It is like handing a loaded 45
Automatic to an 8 year old and telling him to run out and play he commented 
Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target the fire ant 
But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop he said 
The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming 
There have even been serious errors in the U S Forest Service whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training he added 
The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries Buchheister told the delegates 
In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill creation of national seashore parks including Point Reyes  preservation of the wetlands where birds breed  a pesticides co ordination act  stronger water pollution control programs and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil 
The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon Society

Buchheister pledged the land would be an inviolate sanctuary for all birds animals and plants 
Seventeen years ago today German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a *j rocket bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber 
The World War 2 German bomber rolled down a runway and took off 
The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip 
This had never been done before 
Now a quiet spoken middle aged man Fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and Space Division at Sunnyvale where he played a key role in the development of the Navy's Polaris missile 
He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944 
The first two pilots had crashed he said 
I had developed the machines and therefore knew them 
It was time to go up myself 
Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler's super secret Reichenberg project which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war 
About 200 of the special *j rocket bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead 
The target was Allied shipping  a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe 
The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's flight 
Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude 
At 12 000 feet Fiedler signaled release and started the roaring pulse jet engine  then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel 
To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m p h 
It was probably man's first successful flight in a missile 
She flew beautifully said Fiedler 
There was only one power control  a valve to adjust the fuel flow 
I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip 
Using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage 
He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m p h   fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown  and banked into the airfield 
Moments later the *j skimmed across the landing strip edging closer and closer to a touchdown  then in a streamer of dust it landed 
Fiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles 
The missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb 
Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water striking below the waterline of individual ships 
A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers but the project was halted before the end of the war and the missiles later fell into Allied hands 
Now a family man with three children Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale 
His spare time is spent in soaring gliders 
It's so quiet he said so slow serene  and so challenging

Dr Albert Schweitzer world famous theologian and medical missionary has endorsed an Easter March for Disarmament which begins tomorrow in Sunnyvale 
Members of the San Francisco American Friends Service a Quaker organization will march to San Francisco for a rally in Union Square at 2 p m Saturday 
In a letter to the American Friends Service Dr Schweitzer wrote  leading nations of the West and of the East keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out 
They cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack 
The only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons  otherwise no peace is possible 
Governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger  therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency 
A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of Ben Stein 47 who collected big fees as a labor consultant and operator of a janitors' service 
Before he testified for 20 minutes Stein who lives at 3300 Lake Shore Dr  admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums 
Glimco a buddy among his gangland buddies he said were Joseph  Joey  Glimco a mob labor racketeer and four gang gambling chiefs Gus  Slim  Alex Ralph Pierce Joe  Caesar  Di*varco and Jimmy  Monk  Allegretti 
Another hoodlum Louis Arger drew $39 000 from Stein's janitor firm the National Maintenance company in three years ending in 1959 Stein disclosed in an interview 
I put Arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier Stein said 
But Arger never was able to produce it so I cut him off my payroll 
Connection is sought other witnesses after appearances before the jury which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of gangsters including Glimco and Alex 
The federal lawyers according to their witnesses also were tracing Stein's fees as a labor consultant 
Under scrutiny two of the witnesses said were payments and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison St 
The company supplies janitors and workmen for Mc*cormick Place and factories liquor firms and other businesses 
Lee a witness among the witnesses were Ed J Lee director of Mc*cormick Place  Jerome Leavitt a partner in the Union Liquor company 3247 S Kedzie Av  Dominic Senese a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony Accardo onetime gang chief  and Frank W Pesce operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm the Best Sanitation and Supply company 1215 Blue Island Av 
Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors in Mc*cormick Place 
Stein's fee Lee said was 10 per cent of the janitors' pay 
Stein estimated this amount at about $1 500 or $1 600 a month 
A $12 500 payment Leavitt as he entered the jury room said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12 500 his liquor firm paid to Stein for labor consultant work with five unions which organized Leavitt's workers 
Leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman's local the teamsters union a salesman's union the janitors' union and a bottling workers' union 
Government attorneys Leavitt said have questioned him closely about five or six loans totaling about $40 000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the last year 
All of the loans in amounts up to $5 000 each have been repaid by Stein according to Leavitt 
Stein said he needed the money Leavitt said to meet the payroll at National Maintenance company 
The deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco's discredited taxi drivers' union at 1213 15 Blue Island Av 
The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over Chicago yesterday

The weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week 
A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation 
Curtis Allen Huff 41 of 1630 Lake Av  Wilmette was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association 1 S Dearborn St  where he formerly was employed as an attorney 
Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20 000 altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10 000 
Lien payments involved Huff's attorney Antone F Gregorio quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff as attorney for the loan association in satisfaction of mechanic's liens on property on which the association held mortgages 
Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living 
Huff who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September of this year said that his private practice was not lucrative 
Huff lives with his wife Sue and their four children 6 to 10 years old in a $25 000 home with a $17 000 mortgage 
Charge lists 3 checks the complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by Leo Blaber an attorney for the association 
The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept 18 
On that date according to Gregorio Huff left his home and took a room in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence Av 
There Gregorio said Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense 
Later Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the Sherman House using a credit card 
All bounced 
When Huff attempted to cash another $100 check there Monday hotel officials called police

Probably the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue which was sold to the public during the past week 
For many reasons the demand to buy shares in the Dallas headquartered company was tremendous 
It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock  it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell 
Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many 
In fact very few customers anywhere in the nation were able to get more than 100 shares 
Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares for all of their customers 
A measure of how hot the stock was can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began 
The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12 50 a share 
The first over the counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler Guerin & Turner the managing underwriter was at $17 a share 
And from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $22 a share 
But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the market 
Indeed from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last January the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up 
Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold  185 000 to the public at $12 50 with another 5 000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at $11 50 a share  
There was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering 
We subscribe 500 shares of Morton Foods of Texas 
Cable confirmation it said translated 
But E *g *t could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares 
After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone 
But the result of it all was E *g *t partner Dean Guerin believes an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation 
I feel confident the stock will qualify for the national list he said meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country 
He was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do 
But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one 
The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances 
First the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months driving stocks of all kinds up 
As a result it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced  at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64 cent anticipated dividend  
Second the potato chip industry has caught the fancy of investors lately and until Morton Foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks  Frito and H W Lay  on the market 
Both of those have had dynamic run ups in price on the market in recent months both were selling at higher price earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run up 
And third the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a growth industry in the public mind of late 
Foods which long had been considered recession resistant but hardly dynamic stocks have been acting like growth stocks going to higher price earnings ratios 
The potato chip industry these days is growing not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger 
The history of the U *s potato chip industry is that many of today's successful companies got started during the deep depression days 
Those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest 
But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second echelon management in their firms 
So they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like Frito 
All those things combined to make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is 
Now if Morton's newest product a corn chip known as Chip o's turns out to sell as well as its stock did the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to 
Dallas and North Texas is known world wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies valued in the millions of dollars 
More than 10 companies maintain facilities in Dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at Sherman 
It is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner's Association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 52 year history 
The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars 
It weighs in the tons so the proximity of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year 
A modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250 000 and it's a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the U *s and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area 
The Murray Co of Texas Inc  originated in Dallas in 1896 
They've occupied a 22 acre site since the early 1900's 
More than 700 employees make gin machinery that's sold anywhere cotton is grown 
Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except for driers and cleaners and this machinery is purchased from a Dallas based firm 
The Continental Gin Co began operations in Dallas in 1899 
The present company is a combination of several smaller ones that date back to 1834 
Headquarters is in Birmingham Ala 
Factories are located here and in Prattville Ala 
About 40 per cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant by more than 200 employes 
The company sells a complete line of gin machinery all over the cotton growing world 
Hardwicke *etter Co of Sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipment 
The firm recently expanded domestic sales into the Southeastern states as a result of an agreement with Cen *tennial Gin Co 
They export also 
The company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill supplies 
In 1930 they began making cotton processing equipment 
Presently Hardwicke *etter employs 300 450 people depending on the season of the year 
The Lummus Cotton Gin Co has had a sales and service office in Dallas since 1912 
Factory operations are in Columbus Ga 
The district office here employs about 65 
The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co and Gordin Unit System of Ginning have joint headquarters here 
The cleaner equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system which turns out a complete ginning system began operations in 1959 
Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock 
The John E Mitchell Co began work in Dallas in 1928 
The firm is prominent in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton driers and heaters and they lay claim to being the first maker  1910  of boil extraction equipment 
The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation 
Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people 
They export cotton ginning machinery 
The Hinckley Gin Supply Co is a maker of overhead equipment 
This includes driers cleaners burr extractors separators and piping that's located above gin stands in a complete gin 
The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells equipment in the central cotton belt including the Mississippi Delta 
The Cen *tennial Gin Supply Co has home offices and factory facilities here 
They make gin saws and deal in parts supplies and some used gin machinery 
The Stacy Co makes cleaning and drying equipment for sale largely in Texas 
They've been in Dallas since 1921 
Cotton Belt Gin Service Inc of Dallas makes gin saws and started here 14 years ago 
They distribute equipment in 11 states 
The firm also handles gin and oil mill supplies such as belting bearings etc 
Cotton processing equipment is a sizable segment of Dallas business economy 
New car sales in Dallas County during March showed slight signs of recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year 
Registrations of new cars in Dallas County cracked the 3 000 mark in March for the first time this year 
Totaling 3 399 sales jumped 14 per cent over February's 2 963 
However compared with March 1960 new car sales of 4 441 this March was off 23 per cent 
On a quarter to quarter comparison the first quarter of 1961 total of 9 273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year's 3 month total of 11 744 
This year to year decline for Dallas County closely follows the national trend  estimated sales of domestic cars in the U *s for first three months of 1961 were about 1 212 000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier 
With the March pickup dealers are optimistic that the April *june quarter will equal or top last year 
The March gain plus this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules for the next quarter 
On the local level compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense of lower priced standard models and foreign cars 
Only three standard models  Buick Chrysler and Mercury  had slight year to year gains in March sales in the county 
The top 3 students from 11 participating Dallas County high schools will be honored by the Dallas Sales Executives Club at a banquet at 6 p m Tuesday in the Sam Houston Room of the Sheraton *dallas Hotel as the club winds up its annual Distributive Education project 
Now in its third year the program is designed to provide a laboratory for those youngsters seeking careers in marketing and salesmanship 
Business firms provide 20 weeks of practical employment to supplement classroom instruction in these fields 
More than 500 juniors and seniors are taking part in the program and 100 firms offer jobs on an educational rather than a need basis 
Principal address will be delivered by Gerald T Owens national sales manager for Isodine Pharmical Corp of New York 
The 33 honored students are  Mike Trigg Raymond Arrington and Ronald Kaminsky of Bryan Adams Janice Whitney Fil Terral and Carl David Page of W H Adamson  Bill Burke Tommie Freeman and Lawrence Paschall of N R Crozier Tech Paulah Thompson Gerald Kestner and Nancy Stephenson of Hillcrest  Arnold Hayes Mary Ann Shay and Lloyd Satterfield of Thomas Jefferson  William Cluck Deloris Carrel Carty and Edna Earl Eaton of North Dallas  Patricia Ann Neal Johnny Carruthers and David Mc*lauchlin of Rylie of Seagoville  David Wolverton Sharon Flanagan and James Weaver of W W Samuels  William Austin Gary Hammond and Ronnie Davis of South Oak Cliff  Bill Eaton Carolyn Milton and Ronnie Bert Stone of Sunset  and Charles Potter Ronnie Moore and Robert Bailey of Woodrow Wilson 
The Kennedy administration's new housing and urban renewal proposals particularly their effect on the Federal Housing Administration came under fire in Dallas last week 
The Administration's proposals complex and sweeping as they are all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core stated Caron S Stallard first vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America 
Santa Barbara  the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn Beryl W Sprinkel economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank Chicago predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn  California group conference 
Another speaker William H Draper Jr  former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper Gaither & Anderson urged the U *s to throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be pushed around any more 
He urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations 
Not flash in pan Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a temporary flash in the pan but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern 
In view of the current expansion which promises to be substantial he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months but there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 
Thesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth declaring that this pessimism is based on very limited and questionable evidence 
Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959 60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth he said it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery 
Danger cited he cautioned that the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation 
The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 
The unsatisfactory 1958 60 expansion he said was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike 
Sacrifices needed Draper declared as I see it this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today 
We must justify our heritage 
We must be ready for any needed sacrifice 
He said from his experience of two years with Gen Clay in West Berlin administration that Russia respects our show of strength but that presently we're not acting as we should and must 
He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action and noted that in war you can't buy yourself out and that's what we're trying to do 
While he declined to suggest how he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere 
Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and I don't believe we can permit that 
New York  A*p   stock market Tuesday staged a technical recovery erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks 
Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped for support level represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial average 
It was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages 
Some good news although it looked like a routine technical snapback to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some good news 
A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods was reported for last month 
Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next year paving the way for lower taxes 
The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 7 19 to 687 87 
Of 1 253 issues traded 695 advanced and 354 declined 
New highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14 
Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day 
Volume dipped to 3 28 million shares from 3 98 million Monday 
A $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by Peter G Peterson head of one of the world's greatest camera firms in a key address before the American Marketing Assn 
However Peterson president of Bell & Howell warned 800 U *s marketing leaders attending a national conference at the Ambassador that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and unconventional wisdom 
Creations needed as we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed Peterson said 
With this kind of new product log jam the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically 
The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short term advantage which it often needs 
Nothing to fear Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas 
He cited as an example how the American camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs by improving its production know how and technology 
He also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all automatic camera in Germany with the result that it became the best selling camera in the German market 
Election of Howard L Taylor to membership in Pacific Coast Stock Exchange effective Tuesday has been announced by Thomas P Phelan president of the exchange

Union Oil Co of California Tuesday offered $120 million in debentures to the public through a group of underwriters headed by Dillon Read & Co  to raise money to retire a similar amount held by Gulf Oil Corp 
Gulf's holdings could have been converted into 2 700 877 shares of Union Oil common upon surrender of debentures plus cash according to Union 
Under the new offering only $60 million in debentures are convertible into 923 076 common shares 
Due in 1986 the new offering Tuesday consisted of $60 million worth of 4 7/8 debentures due June 1 1986 at 100% and $60 million of 4 1/2% convertible subordinated debentures due June 1 1991 at 100% 
The convertible debentures are convertible into common shares at $65 a share by June 1 1966  $70 by 1971  $75 by 1976  $80 by 1981  $85 by 1986 and $90 thereafter

Question  I bought 50 shares of Diversified Growth Stock Fund on Oct 23 1959 and 50 more shares of the same mutual fund on Feb 8 1960 
Something has gone wrong some place 
I am getting dividends on only 50 shares 
In other words I am getting only half the dividends I should 
Answer  write to the fund's custodian bank  the First National Bank of Jersey City N *j 
That bank handles most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock Fund Fundamental Investors Diversified Investment Fund and Television *electronics Fund 
The bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data processing system to handle things 
But it seems that this electronic brain wasn't programmed correctly 
This resulted in a great number of errors 
And letters began to come in to this column from irate shareholders 
I visited the bank in March and wrote a story about the situation 
At that time the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation in hand 
They indicated that no new errors were being made and that all old errors would be corrected within 60 days 
That 60 day period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of these four funds complaining about mistakes in their accounts 
Maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers expected 
Any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake in his account certainly should get in touch with the bank

Washington  A*p   Alfred Hayes president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Tuesday there is no present need for far reaching reforms which would basically alter the international financial system 
Hayes said that if a way can be found to deal effectively with short term capital movements between nations there is no reason in my judgment why the international financial system cannot work satisfactorily for at least the foreseeable future 
Washington  U*p*i   New York Central Railroad president Alfred E Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the Chesapeake & Ohio and Baltimore & Ohio Railroads merge 
Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger but could possibly be an ultimate effect 
The railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate Commerce Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the *j & *j request to control and then merge with the *j & *j 
All these kind of things weaken us Perlman said 
Bad condition Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co  testified the *j & *j was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad 
The financial situation of the Baltimore & Ohio has become precarious  much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s he told the hearing 
*j & *j president Walter J Tuohy was summoned back for cross examination by New York Central attorneys before examiner John Bradford who is hearing the complex case 
The New York Central also has asked the *j to permit it to gain control of the *j & *j 
Central was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to make it a three way merger 
The proposed *j & *j & *j railroad would make it the hemisphere's second largest

This was the chief reason for a so so sales outlook given by two thirds of 56 builders polled by the National Housing Center 
Other reasons mentioned by one third or more of the builders were resistance to high interest rates cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify 
Increase expected the poll was taken at the Center's annual builders' intentions conference 
It disclosed that the builders  expect their own production volume and presumably sales to jump 30 percent in 1961 
Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960's 1 257 7000 non farm housing starts 
The industry has said 1960 was a poor year 
Starts were down 20 percent from 1959 
Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts for themselves and for the industry 
Leaders of industry the reason says the Housing Center is that the builders invited to the intentions conference are generally among the more successful businessmen and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders 
Elburn Ill   farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales  we've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more 
We sold only four pickers all last year 
Gus Ehlers competitor of Mr Houtz in this farm community says his business since August 1 is running 50% above a year earlier 
Before then my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% he says 
Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas 
Paradoxically the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output 
Although the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 farmers with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines 
Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently 
The higher price supports provided by the new legislation together with rising prices for farm products are pushing up farm income making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery 
Seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year 
In August our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September retail sales were 14% higher than last year says Mark V Keeler farm equipment vice president of International Harvester Co 
For the year to date sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 
Two of three report gains among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% 
Not all sections are showing an upswing however  the drought seared North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend 
The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry 
The demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally 
Farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products 
More than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances chemicals and other products 
Farmers are so eager for new machinery that they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago dealers report 
Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale says Jack Martin who sells J I Case tractors and implements in Sioux City Iowa 
This morning we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2 700 model 
Last year we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine 
Mr Martin sold 21 tractors in August  in August of 1960 he sold seven 
Dealers' stocks down with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country's farm equipment manufacturers 
For example farm equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed about 5% above a year earlier Mr Keeler reports 
Tractor production at Massey *ferguson Ltd  of Toronto in July and August rose to 2 418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier says John Staiger vice president 
With the lower dealer inventories and the stepped up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements 
Merritt D Hill Ford Motor Co vice president says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers 
Except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 retail farm equipment sales have trailed year earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 
The rise in sales last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program was adopted  the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and as a result reduced the immediate need for machines 
Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects 
Total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947 49 average three points higher than the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 
The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects 
Agriculture Department economists estimate the Government this year will hand farmers $1 4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments well above the record $1 1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 
Price support loans may total another $1 billion this year 
With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 farmers' gross income is estimated at $39 5 billion $1 5 billion above 1960's record high 
Net income may reach $12 7 billion up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 
The Government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid *september for the third consecutive month reaching 242% of the 1910 14 average compared with 237% at mid *july 
Kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a High Court depletion ruling 
The Supreme Court decision in mid 1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined 
The company in figuring its taxable earnings deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products 
Such depletion allowances in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets 
The High Court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground not to the revenue from finished products 
A measure passed by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact on prior year returns still under review for clay mining companies that make brick and tile products 
The measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone 
President Kennedy in signing the relief measure into law stressed he regarded it as an exception 
My approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries the President said 
Charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the I *r *s 
The Service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date purpose amount and other particulars of the contribution 
Requests for substantiation the Service indicated can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return such as tickets to a show 
In such an instance revenuers stressed the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received 
A rule on the Federal deductibility of state taxes is contested 
A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax under Federal law on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation 
Louisiana however collected an income tax on the profits from the sale 
The corporation in filing its final Federal income return claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense as permitted under U *s tax law 
The Revenue Service disallowed the claim invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax exempt income 
The Tax Court rejected this view 
It said the tax freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations 
The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year old I *r *s ruling on the subject 
The Service has not said what its next step will be 
Peace Corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency 
It provides that the $1 800 termination payment each cadet is to get after serving a two year hitch without pay will be spread over both years not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received 
The owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and kicked back to the company's advertising manager the Tax Court ruled 
The taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager 
The Court upheld the taxpayer's contention that these kickbacks were not his income though they passed through his hands 
The Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved commenting  it is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction 
A portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel 
The Revenue Service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers' excise tax on household type appliances 
Hiring the wife for one's company may win her tax aided retirement income 
A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls for example may be entitled to distributions under the company's pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverage 
She would be taxed on the pensions when received of course but the company's contributions would be tax free 
A frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement experts warn is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income 
In that event they note the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law 
Possible upshots  the company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made 
State briefs  voters in four counties containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area 
Colorado has a 2% sales tax 
Denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax 
The Washington state supreme court ruled that the state's occupation tax applied to sales made at cost to an oil company by a wholly owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent 
The state's occupation tax is computed on gross sales 
The court held that the tax applied to non profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities 
Washington  consumer spending edged down in April after rising for two consecutive months the Government reported 
The Commerce Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in April down 1% from the March level of more than $18 2 billion 
April sales also were 5% below those of April last year when volume reached a record for any month $18 9 billion  see chart on Page One  
The seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this year two weeks earlier than in 1960 and pre *easter buying was pushed into March 
Commerce Department officials were inclined to explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in March 
Adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2 5% from those of the month before which in turn were slightly higher than the January low of $17 8 billion 
Greer Garson world famous star of stage screen and television will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession 
As a Neiman *marcus award winner the titian haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season 
She will receive the 1961 Oscar at the 24th annual Neiman *marcus Exposition Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton *dallas Hotel 
The only woman recipient Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi creator of chic beautiful women's fashions  Harry Rolnick president of the Byer *rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men's hats  Sydney Wragge creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris France whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry 
The silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus president of Neiman *marcus Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center 
The attractive Greer Garson who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles prefers timeless classical designs 
Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because it's unlike me 
In private life Miss Garson is Mrs E E Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas where they maintain an apartment to their California home in Los Angeles' suburban Bel *air to their ranch in Pecos New Mexico 
Therefore her wardrobe is largely mobile to be packed at a moment's notice and to shake out without a wrinkle 
Her creations in fashion are from many designers because she doesn't want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any more than she wants all of her pictures by one painter 
A favorite is Norman Norell however 
She likes his classic chemise 
Her favorite cocktail dress is a Norell a black and white organdy and silk jersey 
Irene suits rate high because they are designed for her long bodied silhouette 
She also likes the femininity and charm of designs by Ceil Chapman and Helen Rose 
Balenciaga is her favorite European designer 
I bought my first dress from him when I was still a struggling young actress she reminisces 
I like his clothes for their drama and simplicity and appreciate the great impact he has on fashion 
Black and white is her favorite color combination along with lively glowing pinks reds blues and greens 
Of Scotch *irish *scandinavian descent Greer Garson was born in County Down Ireland 
Her mother was a Greer and her father's family came from the Orkney Isles 
Reared in England she studied to be a teacher earned several scholarships and was graduated with honors from the University of London 
She took postgraduate work at the University of Grenoble in France and then returned to London to work on market research with an advertising firm 
Her acting began with the Birmingham Repertory Company and she soon became the toast of the West End 
Among stage performances was a starring role in Golden Arrow directed by Noel Coward 
It was during Old Music at the St James Theater that Hollywood's Louis B Mayer spotted her 
After signing a motion picture contract she came to America and had goodbye Mr Chips as her first assignment after a year's wait 
Other triumphs include Random Harvest Madame Curie Pride and Prejudice The Forsythe Saga and Mrs Miniver  which won her the Academy Award in 1943  
Honors that have come to Greer Garson are countless 
Just this April she was nominated for the seventh time for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in Sunrise at Campobello 
She gave a fine portrayal of Auntie Mame on Broadway in 1958 and has appeared in live television from Captain Brassbound's Conversion to Camille 
She is in Madame Tussard's Waxworks in London a princess of the Kiowa tribe and an honorary colonel in many states

She now serves on the board of directors of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Theater Center and on the board of trustees of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts 
She is state chairman for the New Mexico Tuberculosis and Cancer Associations 
Both Miss Garson and her oilman rancher husband are active supporters of Boys Clubs of America and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that flourishes in New Mexico 
Back in college today's handsome Gander was the only male member of a Texas Tech class on food 
The pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long  but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy 
Last October he gave a public speech in Washington D *c entitled Are Women Here To Stay 
So you can see that Gerald G Ramsey director of *j food services is not the ordinary type of craven women trodden chef 
He is apt to rear back and claim his rights 
Ramsey as *j food wrangler buys enough groceries to serve 32 000 meals a week 
Tell that to the little wife when she moans at the woman's burden ] he also dishes up 3 000 snacks 
And he operates three cafeterias in the Student Center along with Mc*elvaney Dining Hall and the athlete's tables 
Ramsey 6 3 195 and ruggedly slim says I can't remember when I didn't pester my mother to teach me to cook 
He was in charge of the Hockaday School meals from 1946 to 1950 before he moved to *j 
And you'll notice that in both places there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line 
What does he feed his *j football mastodons at the training table 
Mostly meat and potatoes  they have to have that go go go without getting too fat says Ramsey 
So he hides the mayonnaise 
And to keep athletes' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress he bans all highly flavored condiments 
What do the pretty *j girls like on their plates 
Pretty much hamburger hotdogs steak and at night maybe pizza says the handsome food expert 
Unfortunately there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower 
Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman Henry Cabot Lodge the King of Morocco Clement Atlee and other shiny characters 
Once four Tibetan monks in their saffron robes filed through the cafeteria line 
They aren't supposed to look at women you know Ramsey recalled 
What with all those pretty girls around they had a hard time 
Chicken Cadillac use one 6 ounce chicken breast for each guest 
Salt and pepper each breast 
Dip in melted butter and roll in flour 
Place side by side in a 2 inch deep baking pan 
Bake slowly about one hour at 250 275 F until lightly brown 
Add enough warmed cream seasoned to taste with onion juice to about half cover the chicken breasts 
Bake slowly at least one half hour longer 
While this is baking saute mushrooms fresh or canned in butter 
Sprinkle over top of chicken breasts 
Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow baked ham and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes 
 leave off the ham and you call it Chicken Pontiac says Ramsey 
 contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor straight line modern but has sculptured pattern many design facets warmth dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability 
That is the goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month 
Though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated but warm look in contemporary 
These two Heritage and Drexel chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece but a collection of correlated designs each of which could stand alone 
The Heritage collection to be shown by Sanger *harris and Anderson's Studio has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time 
Called Perennian to indicate its lasting good today and tomorrow quality the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces 
Walnut wormy chestnut pecan three varieties of burl hand woven Philippine cane ceramic tiles marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors brick or paneled walls windows that bring in the outdoors 
It is a collection with a custom design look offering simplicity with warmth variety and vitality 
The Drexel collection called Composite to be shown by Titche's offers a realistic approach to decorating a mature modern that is a variation of many designs 
Rounded posts give a soft sculptured look paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia 
A high legged buffet provides easy to reach serving a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end recessed arched panels decorate a 60 inch long chest 
An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented with a young basic functional group of chests dressers and corner units and a canted headboard 
The other bedroom has heavier styling door fronted dressers with acacia panels a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror 
Colorful bright Eastman Chromspun fabrics with the magenta pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with Composite 
The fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles 
Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote Drexel's fall 1961 group Composite 
The spider leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top 
See through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji flavor 
To bring warmth to the dining area golden orange tones are used in the fabrics 
Dignity and comfort in a contemporary manner reflecting the best aspects of today's design with substance and maturity keynote the Perennian collection from Heritage 
Center panel hand screened wood actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases 
Mellow bronzy green gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander Smith carpet in all wool loop pile 
The Vagabonds are on the road again

There will be a large drawing of a sunbonnet girl with eyes that flash at the guests 
Mr and Mrs Phil G Abell are chairmen for the Saledo trip 
Committee members aiding them in planning the entertainment are *j and *j Roy Mc*kee George Mc*elyee Jack Fanning W H Roquemore and Joe Darrow 
The travel club is comprised of 75 fun loving couples who have as their motto Go Somewhere Anywhere Everywhere 
Their activities will be climaxed in the spring of 1962 when they go to Europe 
In the past the men and women have chartered planes to Las Vegas and Jamaica buses to Mineral Wells and Kerrville and private railway coaches to Shreveport and Galveston 
Four parties are given a year 
Two of these are in or near Dallas and the others away from the vicinity 
Serving on the club's board are *j R P Anderson president  A F Schmalzried secretary  W H Roquemore treasurer and the following chairmen  *j Mc*kee publicity  Lawrence B Jones yearbook and Sam Laughlin scrapbook 
A cookie with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $25 000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake *off Tuesday 
Mrs Alice H Reese wife of an engineer and mother of a 23 year old son was awarded the top prize at a luncheon in the Beverly Hilton Hotel 
Mrs Reese entered 10 past bake offs before she got into the finals 
Second grand prize of $5 000 went to Mrs Clara L Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee ring a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze 
Mother of five Mrs Oliver is mother of five children and wife of a machinist 
She lives in Wellsville Mo 
Mrs Reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake off finals 
And the third time was the charm 
She dreamed up the cookie recipe tried it liked it and entered it in the contest 
The second baking was for photographing when told she was a finalist 
The third time was on the floor of the Beverly Hilton ballroom and for the critical eyes and tongues of judges 
Mr and Mrs Joseph R Bolker will give a dinner on Friday at their home in Beverly Hills to honor Mrs Norman Chandler chairman of the Music Center Building Fund Committee and Mr Chandler

Others are Drs and Mmes Alfred Robbins and J Lafe Ludwig and Gen and Mrs Leroy Watson 
Guests from across U *s honor Dr Swim when Dr W A Swim celebrated his 75th birthday at the Wilshire Country Club guests came by chartered plane from all over the country 
A flight originating in Florida picked up guests on the East Coast and Midwest and a plane left from Seattle taking on passengers at West Coast points 
Cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons who had known Dr Swim when he practiced in Los Angeles 
He started practice in 1917 and served on the State Board of Medical Examiners 
Giving up the violin opened a whole new career for Ilona Schmidl *seeberg a tiny Hungarian who Fritz Kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage 
A heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10 hour daily practicing 
She put the violin away and took out some linen needles and yarn to while away the long idle days in Budapest 
Now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and at 26 she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in Los Angeles 
Her days as an art student at the University of Budapest came to a sudden end during the Hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband Stephen fled to Vienna 
There they continued their studies at the university she in art he in architecture 
And there she had her first showing of tapestry work 
There's a lot of talk about the problem of education in America today 
What most people don't seem to realize if they aren't tied up with the thing as I am is that 90% of the problem is transportation 
I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until at long last both of my boys got squeezed into high school 
It seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger paint at the grammar school 
Getting to and from school was no problem 
They either walked or were driven 
Now they go to a high school that is two miles away 
One might think the problem would be similar 
They could walk ride on a bus or be driven 
It's much more complex than that 
Generally they go to school with a girl named Gloriana who lives down the block and has a car 
This is a way of getting to school but I understand it entails a certain loss of social status 
A young man doesn't like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even in a higher class than he is and is also a girl 
Why don't you walk to school then 
I suggested 
My father walked through two miles of snow in Illinois 
Did you 
I was asked 
No I said I didn't happen to grow up in Illinois 
I explained however that I had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom 
I had to ride a streetcar two miles 
Sometimes the streetcar was late 
Sometimes there weren't even any seats 
I had to stand up with the ladies 
Sometimes I got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at all but wound up at the ocean or some other dismal place and had to spend the day there 
I've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then 
When they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car 
She has to have at least one car herself 
I feel a certain loss of status when I am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife who is only a woman 
Even that isn't satisfactory 
If they have to take any car they'd rather take the big one 
They say that when they take a car Gloriana doesn't take her car but rides with them 
But when Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her so the little car isn't big enough 
The logic of that is impeccable of course except that I feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car by my wife when everybody knows I have a big car and am capable of driving myself 
The solution naturally is the bus 
However it's a half mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus and it's too hard on my legs 
My wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there 
But that's hardly realistic 
Nobody walks anymore but crackpots and Harry Truman and he's already got an education 
Advance publicity on the Los Angeles Blue Book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the New York Social Register which made news last week 
Published annually by William Hord Richardson the 1962 edition subtitled Society Register of Southern California is scheduled to arrive with Monday morning's postman 
Publisher Richardson has updated the Blue Book but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever changing telephone numbers addresses other residences club affiliations and marriages

Here's an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute and is completely charming using puppets for lamp bases 
Most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action rather than put away in boxes 
Displayed as lamps the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent 
To create such a lamp order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop 
Measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket allowing three to four inches above the puppet's head 
Make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted *j the foot of the *j about three inches long so that the puppet can hang directly under the light 
Pulling strings using the strings that manipulate the puppet suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base 
In this way you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position with feet or one foot barely resting on the pedestal 
If the puppets are of uniform size you can change them in accord with your child's whims 
Although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child's playtime 
Those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry go round 
The scalloped edge is particularly appealing 
Today's trend toward furniture designs from America's past is teaching home owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial era 
A generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions 
In the background lurked the feeling however that these pieces beautiful as they were lacked the utilitarian touch 
So junior's bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the hard knocks while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only 
This isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's according to decorator consultant Leland Alden 
Housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs says Mr Alden and they are doing it largely because Colonial craftsmen had an innate sense of the practical 
Solid investment there are a number of reasons why the Eighteenth Century designer had to develop down to earth designs  or go out of business 
Hotel Escape's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction the versatile Kings 4 Plus Two 
This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while  a well integrated fast moving outfit specializing in skits vocals comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch 
Show spotlights the Kings  George Worth Bill Kay Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens 
The Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine and the beat is solid 
In the comedy division the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props 
Net result is some crazy wonderful nonsense part of which can be classed as pure slapstick 
Kings 4 have rated as a popular act in Vegas and Western nightclubs

We like Fike Al Fike an ex schoolteacher from Colorado is currently pursuing the three *j  rhythm reminiscence and repartee  in a return class session at the Trade Winds Hotel 
Al has added some sidemen to the act which makes for a smoother operation but it's substantially the same format heard last spring 
Newcomers are Ernie Kemm on piano Wes Robbins bass and trumpet and Jack Kelly on drums 
It's a solid show but except for some interim keyboarding by Ernie it's Al's all the way 
Maestro's biggest stock in trade is his personality and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience 
He skips around from jazz to blues to boogie  accompanying himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers in on the act 
This is a bouncy show which may get a little too frantic at times but is nevertheless worth your appraisal

Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism's growing threat on our doorstep and around the world 
More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p m Sunday at First Presbyterian Church 
At that time the second half of the Christian Youth Crusade against Communism will be staged 
A young real estate salesman Kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy Air Force 
He was particularly struck by a course on Communist brainwashing 
Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of Communism but never felt there was anything he as an individual could do about it 
When he attended the Christian Anti *communist Crusade school here about six months ago Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it 
The best approach he figured was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church 
And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote  a Biblically strong Christianity 
So the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four hour program 
This Sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation  a review of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted Slack another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the University of Miami  and talks on how their Christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting Communism during high school and college days by Ted Place director of Greater Miami Youth for Christ and Jon Braun director of Campus Crusade for Christ 
The second half of the film Communism on the Map and the movie Operation Abolition also will be shown 
Response to the program has been so encouraging Kern said that a city wide youth school at Dade County Auditorium may be set up soon 
And to encourage other churches to try their own programs Kern said this Sunday's sessions  including the free dinner  will be open to anyone who makes reservations

It will be the second time the assistant manager of a Coral Gables restaurant and his wife have taken part in the twice a year ceremonies for families with new babies 
The first one two years ago changed the routine of their home life 
When you stand up in public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the Christian faith you strive a little harder to uphold those vows explains the slender vice president of the young couples Sunday school class 
Until that first dedication service he and Lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home 
They have five daughters  Coral Lee 5 Glenda Rae 4 Pamela 3 Karen 2 and Shari five months 
But after that service they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table have bedtime prayers and Bible stories 
To their surprise the children all were eager and quite able to take part 
Even the two year old feels miffed if the family has a prayer time without her

The Leningrad Kirov Ballet which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House is I think the finest classical ballet company I have ever seen and the production of the Petipa *tschaikowsky Sleeping Beauty with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing 
This work is no favorite of mine 
I am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial Russia in its most vulgar infantile and reactionary aspect  that its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was  that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people  that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self plagiarisms 
All of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation 
Precise the reasons for this enchantment are numerous but most of them end in ova eva or aya 
In other words no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet 
It seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests  Miss Omsk Miss Pinsk Miss Stalingr oops skip it 
These qualities alone however would not account for their success and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective personality 
It is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the American ballet 
Oh the pain of it that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety is totally absent from the Kirov 
This is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American politics 
But obviously at least some things have changed for the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned 
Irina Kolpakova the Princess Aurora of Friday's performance would be a change for the better anywhere at any time no matter who had had the role before 
She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on and her dancing has a feminine suavity lightness sparkle and refinement which are simply incomparable 
Hit Alla Sizova who seems to have made a special hit in the East was delightful as the lady Bluebird and her partner Yuri Soloviev was wonderfully virile acrobatic and poetic all at the same time in a tradition not unlike that of Nijinsky 
Vladilen Semenov a fine danseur noble  Konstantin Shatilov a great character dancer  and Inna Zubkovskaya an excellent Lilac Fairy were other outstanding members of the cast but every member of the cast was magnificent 
The production designed by Simon Virsaladze was completely traditional but traditional in the right way 
It was done with great taste was big and spacious sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes but sumptuous in a muted pastel like style with rich quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery 
Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra one containing excellent soloists  the violin solos by the concertmaster Guy Lumia were especially fine  but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity 
Mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the San Francisco Chamber Music Society

Sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten concert season  annual members may attend for $16 
Participating members may attend five of the concerts for $9  not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in The Chronicle  
Mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $2 may be addressed to the society 1044 Chestnut Street San Francisco 9 
San Francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children 
Fire Fighters Local 798 which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year issued a call for San Franciscans to turn in discarded toys which will be repaired by off duty firemen 
Toys will not be collected at firehouses this year 
They will be accepted at all branches of the Bay View Federal Savings and Loan Association at a collection center in the center of the Stonestown mall and at the Junior Museum 16th Street and Roosevelt Way 
From the collection centers toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 Second street where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution 
Any needy family living in San Francisco can obtain toys by writing to Christmas Toys 676 Howard street San Francisco 5 and listing the parent's name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12 
Requests must be mailed in by December 5 
Famed cellist Pablo Casals took his instrument to the East Room of the White House yesterday and charmed the staff with a two hour rehearsal 
He was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night for Puerto Rico Governor Luis Munoz Marin

For a good many seasons I've been looking at the naughty stuff on television so the other night I thought I ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies 
After all this year's movies are next year's television shows 
So I went to see La Dolce Vita 
It has been billed as a towering monument to immorality 
All the sins of ancient Rome are said to be collected into this three hour film 
If that's all the Romans did it's a surprise to me that Rome fell 
After television La Dolce Vita seems as harmless as a Gray Line tour of North Beach at night 
I cannot imagine a single scene that isn't done in a far naughtier manner on *j every week 
I believe T*v watchers will be bored 
La Dolce Vita has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average T*v Western 
Week in week out there is more sex to be seen in The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet 
There is more decadence on 77 Sunset Strip 
There are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private eye series 
In another respect television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns 
With the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg the credits are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge Theater 
Most of the emphasis has been placed on a wild party at a seaside villa 
Producer Fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ] the Dolce Vita get together boasted a strip tease  carried as far as a black slip   a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face  a frigid beauty and three silly fairies 
Put them all together and they spell out the only four letter word I can think of  dull 
Apparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall 
What a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining ] as a moral shocker it is a dud 
But this doesn't detract from its merit as an interesting if not great film 
The Chronicle's Paine Knickerbocker summed it up neatly  this is a long picture and a controversial one but basically it is a moral enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps Rome has from her traditional political cultural and religious glories 
And when they sell it to television in a couple of years it can be shown without editing

And you think you have language problems 
The week went along briskly enough 
I bought a new little foreign bomb 
It is a British bomb 
Very austere yet racy 
It is very chic to drive foreign cars 
With a foreign car you must wear a cap  it has a leather band in the back 
You must also wear a car coat 
The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive 
But we couldn't really get along without it 
Where do you put the lighter fluid ha ha 
Asked the gas station man 
The present crop of small cars is enriching American humor 
Gas station people are very debonair about small cars 
When I drove a car with tail fins I had plenty status at the wind and water oases 
My car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth 
This excellent foreign bomb takes only six 
When I had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome the gas people were happy to see me 
Tires O*k 
Check the oil and water sir 
They polished the windshield 
They had a loving touch 
The man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank 
What kind of car is it 
He asked gloomily 
It is a British Austin the smallest they make 
Get much mileage 
About 35 
The gas station man sighed unhappily 
What I always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that 
Crunch that's all she wrote 
I will die rich 
That will be $1 80 said the gas station man 
The windshield looks pretty clean 
Ah the fair weather friends of yesteryear ] when I wheeled about finned fore and aft I was the darling of the doormen 
Dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely 
With a small bomb I tuck it between Cadillacs 
 the last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself

 at last the White House is going to get some much copied furniture by that master American craftsman Duncan Phyfe whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U S Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings 
The American Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion's library 
The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800's 
The gift is being presented by heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey whose famous estate Tranquility was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover N J 
Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago 
This acquisition is a matched perfect set  consisting of two sofas six feet long plus six sidechairs and two armchairs 
The *j has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home 
It is the *j intention to create in the library a miniature museum of Americana before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall 
The room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the Duncan Phyfe furniture 
The *j has found a mantlepiece attributed to Samuel Mc*intyre of Salem Mass  an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792 
The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and is being fitted over the White House library fireplace 
It will be painted to match the paneling in the room 
The *j committee's chairman in charge of the redecoration Mrs Henry Francis Lenygon was in town yesterday to consult with White House staff members on the project 
Mrs Lenygon's committee associates announced formally yesterday by the *j in New York include Mrs Allen Lehman Mc*cluskey and Stephen J Jussel both wellknown Manhattan decorators 
Regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include Frank E Barnes of Boston 
President Kennedy couldn't stay away from his desk for the 75 minute young people's concert played on the White House lawn yesterday by the 85 piece Transylvania Symphony Orchestra from Brevard N C 
But he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music 
At 4 p m the President left the White House to welcome the young musicians students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music Center summer camp and to greet the 325 crippled cardiac and blind children from the District area who were special guests at the concert 
It was the first in the series of Concerts for Young People by Young People to be sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House 
She was not present yesterday however to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience 
She is vacationing at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis Port Mass  and in his welcoming remarks the President said he was representing her 
As he approached the open bandstand erected facing the South entrance to the Executive Mansion the band struck up the Star Spangled Banner and followed it with Hail To The Chief 
I think they played Hail To The Chief better than the Marine Corps Band and we are grateful to them President Kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor James Christian Pfohl 
After paying tribute to the conductor and his white clad youthful students President Kennedy said as an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States  schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music 
He added I think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field 
Displaying his knowledge of music the New England born President remarked that probably the best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont by young Americans  and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers and their work is being duplicated all across the United States 
This is a great national cultural asset and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me representing as I do today my wife to welcome all of you here today at the White House 
As he left the bandstand to return to his office the slender sun tanned Chief Executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests 
He expressed surprise to learn that pretty blonde Patricia Holbrook 16 of Mount Rainier had attended the Joseph P Kennedy School for the Handicapped in Boston 
The nuns there do a wonderful work the President commented 
Patricia now attends the C Melvin Sharpe Health School in the District 
Each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red white and blue ribbon 
They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White House staff 
Many of the music loving members of the President's staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience 
And it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected 
Henry Hall Wilson a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President's staff as liaison representative with the House of Representatives turned guest conductor for a Sousa march the Stars and Stripes Forever 
Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs Kennedy's Social Secretary Letitia Baldrige told about plans for White House youth concerts before the National Symphony Orchestra League in Philadelphia last spring 
He said he contacted a friend Henry Hall Wilson on the President's staff and asked whether his orchestra could play in the series 
A flow of correspondence between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85 student North Carolina group to play the first concert 
One of the most interested students on the tour which the Brevard group took at the National Gallery yesterday following their concert at the White House was Letitia Baldrige social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy 
I was an art major in college Miss Baldrige explained 
I've been here so many times I couldn't count them 
She turned out to be a fan too of Margaret Bouton the Gallery's associate curator of education 
Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5 p m 
The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p m  remaining for about 45 minutes 
The Brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later 
They decided that they thought Rembrandt's self portrait made him look sad  they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael's Alba Madonna and texture in a Monet painting of Rheims Cathedral 
Everybody had heard of Van Gogh the French impressionist 
Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them 
He pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery is the only museum in the country to have a full time music director Richard Bales 
I'm sure you've heard of him and his record The Confederacy 
Along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group went one of the Gallery's blue uniformed guards 
In 45 minutes the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the Renaissance to the late 19th Century 
A few of them said they preferred contemporary art 
Among the other artists whose paintings were discussed were Boucher Courbet Fra Angelico 
The thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the Gallery's rotunda fountain because it's on the second floor 
That imposing somewhat austere and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th St nw took on bustling life yesterday 
More than 250 Scottish Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader Albert Pike who headed the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891 
They came together in the huge high ceilinged Council Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized 
C Wheeler Barnes of Denver head of the Scottish Rite in Colorado praised Pike as a historian author poet journalist lawyer jurist soldier and musician who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the Masonic Order 
The ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House of the Temple 
A reception and tea followed 
About 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States 
The opening session of the 5 day session will begin at 10 a m today 
There will be a pilgrimage to Mount Vernon at 2 30 p m 
A wreath will be placed at the tomb of George Washington one of this Nation's first Masons  a past master of Washington *alexandria Lodge 22 in Alexandria 
The marriage of John and Mary Black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years 
John had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous 
He would come home in the evening tired and discouraged  in no frame of mind to play with their three children or spend much time chatting with his wife 
Hurt by his lack of interest and attention Mary complained often that he didn't help around the house and that he didn't really care about the family 
She accused him of ignoring her 
He in turn told her she demanded too much 
They were both discouraged disgusted and miserable 
Mary decided she had had enough 
Without any definite plan in mind she went to a judge to see what could be done 
The judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations  then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from Family Service before going to a lawyer 
Family Service sharing in *j has five agencies in the Washington area 
They offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems 
Because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up Mr and Mrs Black agreed to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia the agency nearest them 
For nearly a year they have been receiving counseling separately and together in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce 
The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other 
They are now working together toward solving their difficulties 
John received a promotion in his firm 
He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life 
Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings and the children's bed time is frequently preceeded by a session of happy family rough housing 
To outsiders the Blacks seem to be an ordinary happy family and they are  but with a difference 
They know the value of being just that  an ordinary happy family 
Family Service has helped hundreds of families in this area 
Perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital 
But to the families it serves their help cannot be measured 
Family Service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the United Givers Fund 
Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive failed to materialize yesterday park rangers said and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze 
For crucial encounter one of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev 
Mr Kennedy replied  I'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground 
The President knew that a confrontation with Mr Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable 
But he was convinced that the realities of power  military economic and ideological  were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting 
He wanted to buy time to strengthen the U S and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy 
Last Friday the White House announced  President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 
The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East *west relations 
The heightened tension in fact had been a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader 
He was not going to Vienna to negotiate  the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned 
But Mr Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe 
That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting 
Despite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war 
Road to Vienna the U S and Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace at the summit of the nations 
The first time was in 1955 when a full dress Big Four summit meeting produced the spirit of Geneva 
The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle East 
In 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U S 
That meeting produced the spirit of Camp David  a spirit it later turned out that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlement 
On the third occasion  another Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago  there was no problem of an illusory spirit 
Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U S for the *j incident 
The episode tended to confirm the U S belief that propaganda the hope of one sided concessions and the chance to split the Allies rather than genuine negotiation were the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry 
Pre inaugural position thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President Mr Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem 
Shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words  as long as Mr Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way no amount of either smiles or toughness neither Camp David talks nor kitchen debates can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations 
The President had set for himself the task which he believed vital of awakening the U S and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance 
He did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary 
He wanted time too to review the United States' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating 
Above all he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep 
Attitude flexible at the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader 
Ideally he knew it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels 
But Mr Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it 
It would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war to try to probe Mr Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own views 
Moreover an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U S was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions 
Both elements  the caution about a meeting the willingness eventually to hold one  were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E Thompson brought back to Russia late in February 
The letter dated Feb 22 was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk Siberia on March 9 
It dealt mainly with a broad range of East *west issues 
But it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr Khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted 
Developments over the next two months however caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing 
There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House about the advisability of an early meeting not because the international climate was improving but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly 
Deadlock on tests the President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva 
The deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand for a three man  East West and neutral  directorate and thus a veto over the control machinery 
In the U S  strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testing 
Mr Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown or even continued stalemate would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament 
There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons particularly to Communist China 
The question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent 
Moreover Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies including the U N Secretariat and the International Control Commission for Laos 
Mr Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements or even negotiations impossible 
Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting 
Initially the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting 
At the same time there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader as a result of those episodes come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure 
In Cuba the U S had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstep 
In Laos the picture was almost equally bad 
U S willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be neutralized on Soviet terms 
Beyond that Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos  despite warnings that they might do so  allowed Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro *communist forces 
As a result the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast Asia are under increased pressure 
In the light of those events there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach himself 
Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive 
He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out 
The President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning back 
It was in the midst of such White House deliberations that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U S Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in the near future 
Mr Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after consultation with the Allies 
The response from London Paris and Bonn was favorable 
Firm arrangements for the meeting in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and Washington last week 
Apparently at the insistence of the U S  the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized the informal nature of the meeting 
The Washington announcement said  the President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries 
The meeting will however afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries 
The outlook the Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned 67 year old veteran of the cold war who in Mr Kennedy's own words is shrewd tough vigorous well informed and confident and a 44 year old President  his birthday is May 29  with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy 
The announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the U S of both approval and disapproval 
The approval did not arise from an expectation of far reaching agreements at Vienna 
The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations 
But those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary 
Mr Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men 
The feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr Kennedy would give him pause 
Apart from the personal equation another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U *s appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit 
Premier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway 
This time the initiative came in part at least from Washington 
Other allies consulted there was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr Khrushchev the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leaders 
Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity 
Finally there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord 
There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world 
If tests are to be resumed the argument went it is vital that the U S make plain that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union 
Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse 
After Cuba and Laos it was argued Mr Khrushchev will interpret the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness  perhaps even panic  and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds 
Moreover the President is meeting the Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitments 
The question was raised for example as to what attitude the President would take if Mr Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle East 
There are so my biologist friends tell me mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory 
Mollusks are a case in point 
The shell which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme tended to cancel out the possibility of future development 
Though this may or may not be good biology it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education 
There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive  our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities 
The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that 
By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence 
There is however one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture 
Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university 
But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project  certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy 
Official encouragement is one thing but the down to earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds 
American Catholics have responded generously to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning 
They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made 
Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility 
All of this may be understandable enough  it is however in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise 
Yet for better or for worse the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities 
Community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible 
To understand the past history  and the future potential  of American Catholic higher education it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community 
It is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment 
A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere 
The fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension 
The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship 
American Catholic colleges and universities are in a very real sense the product of private enterprise  the private enterprise of religious communities 
Had it not been for such private enterprise diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees 
There is however no point in speculating about such a possibility  the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the family business 
This family community spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement 
It is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American Catholic higher education in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas 
I think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully small enrollments clustered within a few miles of a major Catholic university which is also co educational 
This is not an isolated example  this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough 
It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot 
Apart however from the question of wasteful duplication there is another aspect of the family business spirit in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny 
For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its pursuit of excellence 
At the earlier pre academic excellence stage of Catholic education the operation could be conducted on an intra mural community basis 
But with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training the need for outsiders becomes more pressing 
The problem is not merely that more outside teachers are needed but that a different brand is called for 
Commenting on the earlier stage the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors  in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision making  noted that the term teacher employee  as opposed to e g  maintenance employee  was a not inapt description 
Today however the outsider is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order  otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him  and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university 
And while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement 
In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it  even with the best of intentions he  the President of the university  is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which considered  as it must be by him  in individual terms is inhomogeneous mortal and of extremely varying temperament interests and capabilities 
It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are in their opinion identified with its highest good and  to use that oft repeated phrase  the attainment of excellence 
The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame  it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by the organization which actually owns it becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty 
It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to the organization which actually owns the university  this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical lay tension 
But in any case one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one 
Outside faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business 
There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university 
In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel 
Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession much given to attending meetings and conferences 
Expressions of even low key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype 
In the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott  all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere 
To appreciate the nature of the gamble it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service 
Much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure 
This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated 
When a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services 
A man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the family 
Just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions 
Adequate compensation is indispensable 
Yet adequate compensation  and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place 
Broadly speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university 
Religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification 
There is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that at the college level the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels 
The college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication even informal debates over the luncheon table are a contribution to the total good of the institution 
But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation 
The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the in group that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees is therefore the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself 
This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure 
Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order 
The first is a negative warning  there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high sounding titles but no real authority 
In the case of academic personnel the feeling of participation can hardly be faked 
Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisions 
Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by busy work and ersatz decision making 
In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all 
In the Notre Dame report reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to luncheon table communication 
In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of participation  the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy i e  members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution have their own eating arrangements 
Sen John L Mc*clellan of Arkansas and Rep David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti monopoly laws 
Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti monopoly laws there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions  the law must treat everybody equally 
Or in the words of Anatole France the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich as well as the poor from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges 
The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr Mc*clellan's hearings into corruption in labor management relations and later into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites 
The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program 
In addition disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill 
It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike 
Business Week  Aug 9 1961  reports that the United Aircraft Company against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike decided to keep its plants operating 
The company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors  advertising to attract new employees hiring and training them extra overtime and defective work performed by the new workers 
The company has billed the United States Government for $7 500 000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business 
Rep Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee 
The committee remains unresponsive 
Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator Mc*clellan been heard from on the matter  they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti monopoly laws to the unions 
The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained 
The anti trust laws inform a business that it must compete but along completely undefined lines  it must play a game in which there never is a winner 
The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law 
Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy 
Let us look at the heavy electrical goods industry in which General Electric Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market 
The industry is so structured that price setting by a multi product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated  whether marginal or average pricing is applied 
The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment 
Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price 
Naturally enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time 
Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles they would become the only survivors in the industry 
Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by unfair competition 
But if they show self restraint they don't get the orders 
Under the circumstances the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted 
Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants 
The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government after the conviction that General Electric sign a wide open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows 
In other words the anti trust laws designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday Wednesday and Friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday Thursday and Saturday 
And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday 
The question might be asked  don't the managements of the heavy electrical goods manufacturers know these facts 
Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter expressing their complete confidence in the laws 
The past usefulness of the anti trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold in The Folklore of Capitalism back in 1937 
He wrote   P 211  the anti trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure 
 P 214  anti trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship 
 P 215  when corporate abuses were attacked it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control 
In this manner every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti trust laws 
 Pp 228 229  in any event it is obvious that the anti trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known held together by some of the most fantastic ideas all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government 
This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while 
A plea of nolo contendere followed by a nominal fine after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license 
 the penalties handed out in the electrical case which included jail sentences were unprecedented in anti trust prosecutions perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities 
 if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest 
A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle 
However one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti trust laws are effective and rational 
Quite clearly the anti trust laws are neither effective nor rational  and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union 
Those who favor placing trade unions under anti trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform 
Before 1933 individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English 
The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 implicit in the writing of Section 7*a of the National Industrial Recovery Act has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle 
The Wagner Act the Taft *hartley Act and the Landrum *griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining 
The basic purpose of an effective collective bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition 
If a union cannot perform this function then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud 
The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession 
The problem must be faced squarely 
If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn  unsupported by the way by any agricultural subsidy  then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them 
Human labor was exactly that  a commodity  in eighteenth and nineteenth century America 
As early as 1776 Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations  we have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work  but many against combining to raise it 
Eighteenth century England upon whose customs our common law was built had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies 
In 1825 the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten hour day was denounced by the organized employers who declared  it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies 
There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining but against labor monopoly 
The courts shared the opinion of the employers 
In people vs Fisher Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared  without any officious and improper interference on the subject the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it  but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means 
Compare this statement of a nineteenth century judge with how Congressman Martin according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept 19 1961 defends the necessity of enacting anti trust legislation in the field of labor if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages hours and conditions of employment 
Senator Mc*clellan is proposing the application of anti trust measures to unions in transportation 
His bill allegedly aimed at Hoffa would amend the Sherman Clayton and Norris *la*guardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union  even a sister local in the same international 
Paradoxically the same week in which Senator Mc*clellan was attempting to extend the anti trust act to labor in transportation the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti trust act 
Indeed it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti trust laws  for example the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers 
At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti trust legislation a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates 
The passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies 
It was most effective against trade unions 
In the famous Danbury Hatters case a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices e g  trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer 
The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment 
In 1914 the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity 
The law could not suspend economics 
Labor remained a commodity  but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti trust laws 
The courts by interpretation emasculated the act 
In 1922 the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado Coal Company 
The company sued under the anti trust laws alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce 
 what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise 
 the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce 
The nation the three front war at a closed door session on Capitol Hill last week Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U *s affairs abroad 
Afterward Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen 
What Herter presented said Gore was not a very encouraging review 
That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts 
While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions 
1 Cuba 
Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U *s with a blunt and drastic demand  within 48 hours the U *s had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons  the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U *s citizens plus 120 Cuban employees  
President Eisenhower held an 8 30 a m meeting with top military and foreign policy advisers decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately 
There is a limit to what the United States in self respect can endure said the President 
That limit has now been reached 
Through Secretary Herter Ike offered President elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision 
Kennedy through Secretary designate of State Dean Rusk declined 
He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan 20 although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U *s and Latin America  see the hemisphere  
2 Laos 
After a White House huddle between the President and top lieutenants the Defense Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro *western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet Nam 
In view of the present situation in Laos said the Pentagon's announcement we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific 
Cutting short a holiday at Hong Kong the aircraft carriers Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South China Sea accompanied by a swarm of destroyers plus troopships loaded with marines 
On the U *s 's island base of Okinawa Task Force 116 made up of Army Navy Marine and Air Force units got braced to move southward on signal 
But by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration  see foreign news  and the U *s was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist  rather than a pro *western  government might be best for Laos 
French & Indians 
There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold war fronts 
Political economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war  and they were probably right 
It would be like fighting the French and Indian War all over again said one military man 
But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground 
At Geneva in 1954 to get the war in Indo *china settled the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state North Viet Nam  which then predictably became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos 
The late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West 
He began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of *j 
The important thing from now on he said is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia 
Russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of Havana Russian intrigue in the Congo and Russian arms drops in Laos  using the same Ilyushin transports that were used to carry Communist agents to the Congo  made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time 
Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President elect Kennedy and got a cool acknowledgment in reply 
Considering the state of the whole world the cold war's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous  but in Senator Gore's words it was not a very encouraging situation that would confront John F Kennedy on Inauguration Day 
The Congress turmoil in the House as the 87th Congress began its sessions last week liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor 
The liberal pressure bloc  which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group  had fought the committee before and had always lost 
This time they were much better prepared and organized and the political climate was favorable 
They had the unspoken support of President elect Kennedy whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck 
And counting noses they seemed to have the votes to work their will 
Deadly deadlock 
There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee  1  to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative liberal deadlock or 2  to remove one of the conservatives  namely Mississippi's 14 term William Meyers Colmer  pronounced Calmer  
Caucusing the liberals decided to go after Colmer which actually was the more drastic course since seniority in the House is next to godliness 
A dour gangling man with a choppy gait Colmer looks younger than his 70 years has gradually swung from a moderate internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative 
He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents 
He is of course a segregationist but he says he has never made an anti *negro speech 
For 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee 
There his vote along with those of Chairman Howard Smith the courtly Virginia judge and the four Republican members could and often did produce a 6 6 deadlock that blocked far out Democratic sponsored welfare legislation  a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn *johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes  
Equal treatment 
There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster  he had given his lukewarm support to the anti *kennedy electors in Mississippi 
Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons 
In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman and in 1957 after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage 
 in the heat of the anti *colmer drive last week Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell 
Said he  we will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here 
 but Speaker Sam Rayburn after huddling in Palm Beach with President elect Kennedy decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee  and that he was the only man who could do anything effective 
In a tense closed door session with Judge Smith Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise  to add three new members to the Rules Committee  two Democrats including one Southerner and one Republican  
Smith flatly rejected the offer and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels 
The next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news  he would lead the fight to oust Colmer whom he is said to regard as an inferior man 
News of Rayburn's commitment soon leaked out 
When Missouri's Clarence Cannon got the word he turned purple 
Unconscionable ] he shouted and rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object  a dangerous precedent ] Cannon a powerful conservative man brought welcome support to the Smith *colmer forces  as chairman of the Appropriations Committee he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork barrel projects 
Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge Smith ally Georgia's Carl Vinson chairman of the Armed Services Committee 
Threat of war 
As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses it became clear that Judge Smith could lose 
His highest count of supporters numbered 72  and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260 member Democratic caucus 
The liberals smelling blood were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes  in the Democratic Committee on Committees in the full party caucus and on the floor of the House  before they could oust Colmer 
 one big question  if Colmer was to be purged what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors 
 in all three arenas they seemed certain of victory  especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash 
But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war 
If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships leaving Sam Rayburn leading a truncated unworkable party 
With that possibility in mind Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort of face saving compromise 
Here are two old men mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone said a House Democratic leader 
One wants a little more power and the other doesn't want to give up any 
Battle in the senate the Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal conservative battle but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a Capitol guide's speech 
Question at issue  how big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate  and thereby cut off legislation delaying filibusters 
A wide ranging bipartisan force  from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall  was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills 
New Mexico's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's notorious Rule 22 to allow three fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate instead of the current hard to get two thirds 
Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators 
Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely and the battle was joined 
Privately the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage 
Privately they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon 
In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding 
Armed with the Nixon opinion the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week 
Hopefully the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all 
Republicans last act since Election Day Vice President Richard Nixon had virtually retired  by his own wish  from public view 
But with the convening of the new Congress he was the public man again presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's Inauguration 
One day last week Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote and then to make sufficient declaration of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election 
Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace then went beyond the required sufficient declaration 
This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated he said 
The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves 
Gary Player the small trim South African was the eventual winner but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap 
Arnold Palmer the defending champion lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief 
Just when you think you have it licked this golf course can get up and bite you Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament 
And that is just what happened on the last few holes 
The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer 
Player was the first to feel its teeth 
After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34  two strokes under par  on this fifth and final day of the tournament  Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed  Player's game rapidly fell to pieces 
He bogeyed the 10th 
After a journey through woods and stream he double bogeyed the 13th 
He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2 over par 74 and a 72 hole total of 280 
As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course Player was almost in tears 
He could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer by then playing the 15th hole was leading him by a stroke 
Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes 
Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf 
When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole he seemed to have the championship won 
But the seven iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression 
In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green past spectators and down the slope toward a *j tower 
Afterwards Palmer told Charlie Coe his last round partner that he simply played the hole too fast 
He did seem hasty on his second and third shots but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure which he had quite visibly lost 
When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot he overshot the hole by 15 feet 
Palmer was now putting merely for a tie and Player who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt 
Palmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro but it was barely good enough for a second place tie with Coe 
The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 
End at seven until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters  four last year and three this  without ever being out of first place 
As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one over par 73 this remarkable record was still intact thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69 
His three round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score a 213 by Bill Collins the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long 
But Palmer knew as did everybody else at Augusta that his streak was about to be broken 
Half an hour after he finished his round Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three round total of 206 four strokes ahead of Palmer 
More than a streak had ended 
Long after the erratic climate and the washed out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player 
Unlike most such sports rivalries it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously although this was not exactly the case 
When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige 
As if to confirm his stature he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments 
Player won only one 
But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere 
On the final round at Pensacola the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and although it was far from obvious at the time the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come 
On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and as it turned out neither won it 
But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour 
Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer 
He outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71 
Thereafter until the Masters Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami 
When they reached Augusta last week together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date 
Instant rivalry on Thursday the first day of the Masters the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly 
It was a dismal drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course 
The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences 
Palmer's 4 under par 68 got him off to an early lead which he shared with Bob Rosburg 
But Player was only one stroke back with a 69 
Even so it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators  unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever  that this tournament was to be essentially a match between Palmer and Player 
A lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus the spectacular young amateur who had a 70  or Ken Venturi who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better  or Rosburg whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries  or even old Byron Nelson whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf 
 on Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe 
 on Friday a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus 
Rosburg had started early in the day and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course  separated as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend by about half an hour  they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg who ended with a 73 was not having a good day 
As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender 
Player began with a birdie on the first hole added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th 
On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament 
He birdied the 13th the 15th and the 18th  five birdies one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 
Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle Palmer birdied the 2nd the 9th the 13th and the 16th  four birdies one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 
The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph 
At one point late in the day when Palmer was lining up a 25 foot putt on the 16th a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole 
Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed  although he later admitted that he had  Palmer proceeded to sink his 25 footer and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply 
The boldness of champions anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course 
It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence 
The bad luck that can so often mar a well played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions 
Bob Jones played that way 
Byron Nelson did Hogan did 
And last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did 
As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead 
This day Palmer had started first 
As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day 
Player immediately proceeded to follow suit 
In fact he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well to go 4 under par for the first eight holes 
But Player's real test came on the ninth hole a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards 
He hit a poor tee shot pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways 
Having hit one of the trees the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out 
Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 or gambling 
The latter involved hitting a full four wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green 
I was hitting the ball well Player said later and I felt strong 
When you're playing like that you'd better attack 
Player attacked with his four wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget 
It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge 
From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 
Palmer meanwhile had been having his troubles 
They started on the 4th hole a 220 yard par 3 
On this day the wind had switched 180 degrees from the northwest to the southeast and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days 
At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one iron when a three wood was the proper club so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green 
His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par 
Starting the second nine Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it 
When Mickey Charles Mantle the New York Yankees' man of muscle drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers his feat touches upon the sublime 
When Roger Eugene Maris Mantle's muscular teammate powers four home runs in a double header his performance merits awe 
But when tiny 145 pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because as a teammate explained the other team thought no one was out there hits seven home runs in four months  three more than his total in 1958 1959 and 1960  his achievement borders on the ridiculous 
This is Baseball 1961 
This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous 
It is the year when  1  amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and in unprecedented style delivered consecutive grand slam home runs   2  Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game   3  the Milwaukee Braves tied a major league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them  and  4  catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat two of them as a pinch hitter 
Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats the shrinking strike zone and the fact that the knock down pitch is now illegal 
Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion 
Whatever the reasons not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records home run division 
Of all the records in peril one stands apart dramatic in its making dramatic in its endurance and now doubly dramatic in its jeopardy 
This of course is baseball's most remarkable mark  the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure the incredible athlete George Herman  Babe  Ruth of the Yankees 
Since 1927 fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe Ruth's record and each in turn has been thwarted 
What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September surge 
In the final month of the 1927 season he hit seventeen home runs a closing spurt never matched 
Double threat  always in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record one man alone  a Jimmy Foxx  58 in 1932  or a Hank Greenberg  58 in 1938  or a Hack Wilson  56 in 1930   made the bid 
But now for the first time since Lou Gehrig  with 47 home runs  spurred Ruth on in 1927 two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 
Their names are Mantle and Maris their team is the Yankees and their threat is real 
After 108 games in 1927 Ruth had 35 home runs 
After 108 games in 1961 Mickey Mantle has 43 Roger Maris 41 
Extend Mantle's and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games and mathematically each will hit more than 60 home runs 
This is the great edge the two Yankees have going for them 
To better Ruth's mark neither needs a spectacular September flourish 
All Mantle needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September and he will establish a new record 
In Ruth's day  and until this year  the schedule was 154 games 
Baseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games 
 even on the basis of 154 games this is the ideal situation insists Hank Greenberg now vice president of the Chicago White Sox 
It has to be easier with two of them 
How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle 
Roommates  neither Mantle nor Maris understandably will predict 60 home runs for himself 
Although both concede they would like to hit 60 they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote  the important thing is to win the pennant 
But one thing is for certain  there is no dissension between Mantle the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957 and Maris the *j in 1960 
Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs  I hope Roger hits 80 Mantle says  and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs  and I hope I hit 81  
The sluggers get along so well in fact that with their families at home for the summer  Mantle's in Dallas Maris's in Kansas City  they are rooming together 
Mantle Maris and Bob Cerv a utility outfielder share an apartment in Jamaica Long Island not far from New York International Airport 
The three pay $251 a month for four rooms  kitchen dining room living room and bedroom  with air conditioning and new modern furniture 
Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom  Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room 
They divide up the household chores  Cerv does most of the cooking  breakfast and sandwich snacks with dinner out  Mantle supplies the transportation  a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible  and Maris drives the 25 minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium 
Mantle Maris and Cerv probably share one major league record already  among them they have fifteen children  eight for Cerv four for Mantle and three for Maris 
As roommates teammates and home run mates Mantle 29 who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago and Maris 26 who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago have strikingly similar backgrounds 
Both were scholastic stars in football basketball and baseball  Mantle in Commerce Okla  Maris in Fargo N *d   as halfbacks both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma  sometimes in the minors Maris recalls I wished I had gone to Oklahoma  
To an extent the two even look alike 
Both have blue eyes and short blond hair 
Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds but Mantle incredibly muscular  he has a 17 1/2 inch neck  looks bigger 
With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders both must have their clothes made to order 
Maris purchases $100 suits from Simpson's in New York 
Mantle more concerned with dress buys his suits four at a time at Neiman *marcus in Dallas and pays as much as $250 each 
Light reading  neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer 
Mantle so appreciated delicate Miller's literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips 
Mantle is not normally given to public speaking  or for that matter to private speaking 
What do you and Mickey talk about at home 
A reporter asked Maris recently 
To tell you the truth Maris said Mickey don't talk much 
This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer 
What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris under constant pressure from writers and photographers are trying to be cooperative 
Of the two Mantle is by nature the less outgoing Maris the more outspoken 
But last week when a reporter was standing near Mantle's locker Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote 
See that kid 
He said pointing to a dark haired 11 year old boy 
That's  Yogi  Berra's 
I'll never forget one time I struck out three times dropped a fly ball and we lost the game 
I came back sitting by my locker feeling real low and the kid walks over to me looks up and says  you stunk 
Maris in talking to reporters tries to answer all questions candidly and fully but on rare occasions he shuns newsmen 
When I've made a dumb play he says I don't want to talk to anyone 
I'm angry 
By his own confession Maris is an angry young man 
Benched at Tulsa in 1955 he told manager Dutch Meyer  I can't play for you 
Send me where I can play 
 Meyer sent him to Reading Pa 
 benched at Indianapolis in 1956 he told manager Kerby Farrell  I'm not learning anything on the bench 
Play me 
 Farrell did  and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series 
 that's the way I am he says 
I tell people what I think 
If you're a good ballplayer you've got to get mad 
Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times 
Idols' idols  one good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes 
Maris's was Ted Williams 
When I was a kid Maris told a sportswriter last week I used to follow Williams every day in the box score just to see whether he got a hit or not 
When you came up to the majors did you seek out Williams for advice 
Are you kidding 
Said Maris 
You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize 
Mantle's hero was Joe Di*maggio 
When Mickey went to the Yankees says Mark Freeman an ex *yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver Di*maggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man this hero of his 
But Di*maggio never said a word 
It crushed Mickey 
He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star this never would be said of him 
Mantle has kept the vow 
Among all the Yankees he is the veteran most friendly to rookies 
Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else 
If laying ties on a railroad track which he once did for $1 an hour paid more than playing right field for the Yankees Maris would lay ties on a railroad track 
If working in a zinc mine which he once did for 87 1/2 cents an hour paid more than playing center field for the Yankees Mantle would work in a zinc mine 
But since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts Mantle and Maris concentrate on baseball 
They try to play baseball the best they can 
Each is a complete ballplayer 
Mantle beyond any question can do more things well 
 one of the reasons they get along fine says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men is that both realize Mantle is head and shoulders above Maris 
 hitting Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left handed and right handed Maris only left handed 
They both possess near classic stances dug in firmly arms high set for fierce swings 
Mantle is considerably better hitting for average  332
 fourth in the league to 280
For Maris so far this year  
Both are good bunters  Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues  Mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base 
Both have brilliant speed  Mantle was timed from home plate  batting left handed  to first base in 3 1 seconds faster than any other major leaguer  Maris ran the 100 yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio the swift base stealing shortstop of the White Sox 
Both are good daring fielders  Mantle covers more ground  Maris's throwing arm is stronger 
Yet with all their skills the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic  the home run 
With this ultimate weapon the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season 
 American League expansion created inevitably weaker teams 
Only two teams in each league  the Yankees and Detroit the Dodgers and Cincinnati  are battling for first place 
Appropriately the emphasis on the home run at a peak this year came into being at baseball's lowest moment 
In 1920 as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked out fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball 
Something was needed to revive interest  the something was the home run

Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas as he had hinted upon his arrival  it's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia

The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself  his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles 
Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered two of everything just in case he spills anything Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing 
A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps General David M Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a happy warless New Year greeting to his Pentagon staff

After pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard I lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on 
Little geeing and hawing have been necessary 
But Shoup also gave the Corps a tilling in spots 
Speaking of pride he deplored the noncommissioned officer whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940  the officer with the yellow socks or the bay window

G David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh 
There the name vaguely connotes new rich wealth a reputation for eccentricity and an ardor for collecting art 
Last week in the German city of Dusseldorf G David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause 
On display were 343 first class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection  and every single one of them was up for sale 
Like Philadelphia's late Dr Albert C Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public  Time Jan 2  Thompson at 61 is something of a legend in his own lifetime 
He made his fortune during World War 2 when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom 
Even before he hit big money he had begun buying modern paintings 
He gave the impression of never having read a word about art but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best 
He was able to smell a bargain  and a masterpiece  a continent away and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred Barr said of him  I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson didn't know about 
He might barge into a gallery start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting 
He could be lavishly generous with friends cab drivers and bellboys but with dealers he was tough 
He bought up Cezannes Braques Matisses Legers a splendid Picasso series more than 70 Giacometti sculptures 
He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees in the world 
All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's Throw outside Pittsburgh and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them 
Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city 
But he insisted that it be housed in a special museum 
Pittsburgh turned him down just as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years 
He went then to a 40 year old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler with whom he had long been trading pictures 
Last year Beyeler arranged to sell $1 500 000 worth of Klees to the state of North Rhine *westphalia which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built 
Last week most of the other prizes once offered to Pittsburgh went on the block 
At the opening of the Dusseldorf show Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time 
In fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them 
Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town 
Thompson himself said  I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures 
Break in Georgia the University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color 
But in all its 175 years not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms 
Last week Federal District Judge William A Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a qualified Negro boy and girl 
Their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education from kindergarten through graduate school in Georgia  and in Alabama Mississippi and South Carolina as well 
For 18 months Hamilton Holmes 19 and Charlayne Hunter 18 had tried to get into the university 
They graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third 
The university rejected them on a variety of pretexts but was careful never to mention the color of their skins 
Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse  Negro  College where he is a B student and star halfback 
Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University 
Last fall after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again 
Charlayne was tentatively admitted for next fall after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne State 
But Holmes was rejected again on the basis of his record and interview 
The evidence in court was testimony about the interview which for Holmes lasted an hour although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation 
Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution or a beatnik parlor or teahouse 
No said he but officials still called him evasive 
They also said he lied in saying that he had never been arrested 
Their reason  Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine had his license suspended 
Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students found that many were hardly interviewed at all  and few had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes 
The real reason for his rejection they argued is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school 
Judge Bootle's decision  the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color 
The state will appeal  but few think it will actually try to close the university 
Surprised and pleased students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this week 
Catch for Chicago when the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A Kimpton submitted his resignation last March a mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway 
Out went letters to 60 000 old grads asking for suggestions 
Such academic statesmen as James B Conant were consulted 
Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors including Adlai Stevenson Richard Nixon and Harvard's Dean Mc*george Bundy 
The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator but rather as Trustee Chairman Glen A Lloyd put it a top scholar in his own right  a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago 
Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty  dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle 57 who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry  Time Cover July 14 1958  
It fell to Chancellor Kimpton now a Standard Oil  Indiana  executive to spend his nine year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21 year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins 
He threw out some of Hutchins' more wildly experimental courses raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2 100 nearly doubled endowment to $139 3 million 
But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era 
At Caltech Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946 
But he has shown a sixth sense ability to spot recruit and excite able researchers and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech making 
Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters  he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal and took delight in driving a $250 model *j Ford for 22 years then selling it for $300 
A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end 
But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away 
The man was King Leopold 2 of the Belgians who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good 
By force he took under his protection or stole 900 000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa 
This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe  and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity 
Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings  they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking 
The population of the Congo is 13 5 million divided into at least seven major culture clusters and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects 
The religions of the people include Christianity Mohammedanism paganism ancestor worship and animism 
The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate 
The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars 
To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case  it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done or failed to do in the Congo since 1885 
At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property 
But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience 
The Belgian government itself took over administration commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism 
One definition of paternalism is the principle or practice on the part of a government of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children 
The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned  only their judgment 
Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time  but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant 
The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo which is rich in copper tin cobalt manganese zinc and uranium and cotton and palm oil 
The colony was administered from Brussels with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote 
The beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock 
In Inside Africa John Gunther describes one of these the Societe Generale as the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if let us say the House of Morgan Anaconda Copper the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York the Pennsylvania Railroad and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together with the United States government as a heavy partner 
Had they been truly ruthless the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion 
But they were not 
They provided a social security system which covered all their African employes  their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent  they put much effort into public housing 
They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food 
But instead of delivering the ration  either in actual commodities or in cash  at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often 
Would not the children if they received all their food on the first day of the month eat it up immediately and later go hungry 
The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education 
During the 1950s there were as many as 25 000 schools in the Congo 
But almost all the schools were primary 
The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of la chatte and le chien and write his name 
Some schools were technical  the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land and trained many 
But they did not believe in widespread secondary education much less in college 
It was their conviction that the people should be brought up together a grade at a time until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history economics and political science 
Indeed the Belgians discouraged higher education fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest 
When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were among its 13 5 million people exactly 14 university graduates 
Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it 
In one large oversimplification it might be said that the Belgians felt far too late the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa 
They lacked time to prepare the Congo as the British and French had prepared their colonies 
The Congolese were clamoring for their independence even though most were unsure what it meant  and in Brussels street crowds shouted pas une goutte de sang ]  not one drop of blood ]  
The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue  rather than teach where teaching was not wanted they would wash their hands of the mess 
It is hard to blame them for this 
Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless 
As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties or approximately eight for each university graduate 
There were four principal ones 
First there were those Congolese  among them Joseph Kasavubu  who favored splitting the country into small independent states Balkanizing it 
Second there were those  Moise Tshombe  who favored near *balkanization a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority with much power residing in the states 
Third there were those  notably Patrice Lumumba  who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government 
And fourth there were moderates who were in no hurry who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up 
However shifting 
 the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting 
A a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo immediately after independence was the provincial structure the Belgians for convenience in administration that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration 
They had divided the Congo into six 
They had divided the Congo into six provinces  Leopoldville Kasai Kivu Katanga Equator and Eastern  unfortunately with with little regard for ethnic groupings 
Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other and to them independence meant an opportunity for war 
The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western style form of government  there were to be a president and a premier and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces 
Well wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations 
If internal frictions arose they could be handled by the 25 000 man Congolese army the Force still officered by Publique which had been trained and was white Belgians 
The president Joseph Kasavubu seemed an able administrator and the premier Patrice Lumumba a reasonable man 
Twenty four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other 
Presently the well armed members of the Force Publique many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes erupted in mutiny rioting raping and looting 
Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country 
The Belgian government decided to act and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo 
On July 11 the head of the mineral rich province of Katanga Moise Tshombe announced that his province had seceded from the country 
Confusion became chaos  each succeeding day brought new acts of violence 
Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them 
On July 14 the Security Council  with France and Great Britain abstaining  voted the resolution which drew the U *n into the Congo 
Vague in wording it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary *general to take the necessary steps to provide the  Congolese  Government with such military assistance as may be necessary until through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations the national security forces may be able in the opinion of the Government to meet fully their tasks 
Secretary *general Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U *n troops sent into the Congo were to come from African or at least nonwhite nations  certainly not from the U *s  Russia Great Britain or France 
He quickly called on Ghana Tunisia Morocco Guinea and Mali which dispatched troops within hours 
Ultimately the U *n army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19 000 including about 5 000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden who were the only whites 
It took the U *n three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo 
The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U *n efforts 
The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems  he frequently announced that he wanted the U *n to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians and appealed to Russia for help 
 however there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist 
Before appealing to the U *n or to Russia he first appealed to the U *s for military help and was rejected 
 Lumumba further complicated the U *n 's mission by initiating small wars with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which under Albert Kalonji wanted to secede as well 
Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo sending Lumumba equipment for his wars dispatching technicians and even threatening on occasion to intervene openly 
But by the end of the three month period in October 1960 something approaching calm settled on the Congo 
President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him 
Lumumba fired Kasavubu 
Control of the government  such control as there was and such government as there was  passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu chief of staff of the Congolese army 
Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians who have not since played any significant part on the local scene although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U *n headquarters in New York 
The Belgians  at least officially  departed from the Congo as well withdrawing all of their uniformed troops 
But they left behind them large numbers of officers variously called volunteers or mercenaries who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga the seceded province which according to Tshombe holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country 
From October 1960 to February 1961 the U *n forces in the Congo took little action 
There was no directive for it  the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned political matters and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation whether to unify it federalize it or Balkanize it 
During the five month lull civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the Congo 
In February the murder of Patrice Lumumba who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe again stirred the U *n to action 
On Feb 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo including the use of force if necessary in the last resort 
Although the resolution might have been far more specific it was considerably tougher than the earlier one 
It also urged that the U *n eject and prevent the return of all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers  ordered an investigation of Lumumba's death  urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the army 
The presidency  talking and listening though President John F Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser Mc*cloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U *s foreign policy last week 
High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte 
On this issue the President received a detailed report from his U *n Ambassador Adlai Stevenson who had just returned from Paris and Mr Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face saving way  for both Paris and Tunis  out of the imbroglio 
Ideally the President would like the French to agree on a status quo ante on Bizerte and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base 
To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems Mr Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend 
The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No 2 man in the Tunisian Government Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham who flew to Washington last week to seek U *s support 
The conversation apparently convinced Mr Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable 
Through Ladgham Mr Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba  and one U *s official said  the key question now is which side picks up the phone first 
On the Latin American front the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter *american Economic and Social Council  which the President himself had originally hoped to attend  
Main purpose of the meeting  to discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress 
And that was not all 
In conferences with Nationalist China's dapper diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng Mr Kennedy assured Chiang Kai shek's emissary that the U *s is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United Nations 
Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia  however the President who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U *s if Outer Mongolia's admission comes to a vote 
The President also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid 
To Africa he sent his most trusted adviser his brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy on a good will mission to the Ivory Coast 
All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs  in effect he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared  we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk and listen with reason 
Crime  skyjacked from International Airport in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston as the great four jet Boeing 707 flies is a routine five hours and 25 minutes including stopovers at Phoenix El Paso and San Antonio 
When Continental Airlines night coach Flight 54 took off at 11 30 one night last week there was no reason to think it would take any longer 
The plane put down on schedule at 1 35 a m in Phoenix 
Thirty one minutes later when it took off for El Paso hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen age boy who had come aboard 
At 3 57 a m  with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso passenger Robert Berry a San Antonio advertising man glanced up and saw the man and boy accompanied by a stewardess walking up the aisle toward the cockpit 
The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach Berry said 
I figured he was sick 
John Salvador a farmer from Palm Desert Calif  was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit 
The kid had a 45
Automatic like they issue in the Army he said 
The other fellow had a 38
 
Salvador saw the youth hold his 45
Against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey  the man put his 38
At the head of Capt Byron D Rickards 
To Rickards a 52 year old veteran 30 years in the air it was an old story  his plane was being hijacked in mid flight again much as it had happened in 1930 when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri motor at Arequipa 
But last week's pirates like the Cuban *american who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra  Newsweek Aug 7  wanted to go to Havana 
Stalling  tell your company there are four of us here with guns the elder man told Rickards 
The pilot radioed El Paso International Airport with just that message 
But he told the skyjackers the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach Havana  they would have to refuel at El Paso 
Most passengers didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground 
Jerry Mc*cauley of Sacramento Calif  one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board awoke from a nap in confusion 
The old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba Mc*cauley said and like a nut I raised my hand 
I thought he was the Air Force recruiter 
What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages along with the crew 
They chose four  Jack Casey who works for Continental Airlines in Houston  Fred Mullen from Mercer Island Wash  Pfc Truman Cleveland of St Augustine 
Fla  and Leonard Gilman a former college boxer and veteran of the U *s Immigration Service Border Patrol 
Everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4 18 a m 
They found a large welcoming group  El Paso policemen Border Patrol sheriff's deputies and *j men who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns 
Other *j men talking with the pilot from the tower conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to Havana 
The ground crew which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes took fully three hours 
Still more time was consumed while the pilot at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller driven Douglas *j 
Actually the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane  they had orders to that effect straight from President Kennedy who thought at first as did most others that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over the 707 
Mr Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane kept in touch throughout by telephone 
At one time while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot the President talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba 
As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment 
From the luggage they learned that the two air pirates far from being Cubans were native Americans subsequently identified as Leon Bearden 50 year old ex convict from Coolidge Ariz  and his son Cody 16 a high school junior 
Tension the heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens 
The father by accident or perhaps to show as he said we mean business took the 45
And fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons 
At 7 30 a m  more than three hours after landing the Beardens gave an ultimatum  take off or see the hostages killed 
The tower cleared the plane for take off at 8 a m  and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway 
Several police cars loaded with armed officers raced alongside blazing away at the tires of the big jet 
The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines  the plane slowed to a halt 
Ambulances baggage trucks and cars surrounded it 
The day wore on 
At 12 50 p m a ramp was rolled up to the plane 
A few minutes later *j agent Francis Crosby talking fast eased up the ramp to the plane unarmed 
While Crosby distracted the Beardens stewardesses Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door 
So did hostages Casey Cleveland and Mullen 
That left only the four crew members Crosby and Border Patrolman Gilman all unarmed with the Beardens 
The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand the other in a hip pocket 
Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance 
He caught officer Simmons' eye nodded toward young Bearden and  I swung my right as hard as I could 
Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all over 
Frog marched off the airplane at 1 48 p m  the Beardens were held in bail of $100 000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines 
 Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro and live high in Cuba 
 back home in Coolidge Ariz  his 36 year old wife Mary said  I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs 
Congress  more muscle taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nation 
The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass  85 to 0  the largest peacetime defense budget in U *s history 
With the money all but in hand however the Administration indicated that instead of the 225 000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested the armed forces would be increased by only 160 000 
The hold back as Pentagon mutterers labeled it apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and thus the new funds spent prudently 
In all the Senate signed a check for $46 7 billion which not only included the extra $3 5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy but tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for 
 the Senate on its own decided to provide additional *j and other long range bombers for the Strategic Air Command 
 The House which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent call for more was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order 
In other areas Congressional action last week included  the Senate  by voice vote  and the House  by 224 170  passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm bill which the President is expected to sign not too unhappily 
The Senate also voted $5 2 billion to finance the government's health welfare and labor activities 
Debate on the all important foreign aid bill with its controversial long range proposals had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend 
White House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact 
Food  stew a la Mulligatawny most members of the U *s Senate because they are human like to eat as high on the hog as they can 
But because they are politicians they like to talk as poor mouth as the lowliest voter 
As a result ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food  even while they opposed every move that might improve it 
Over the years enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes the menu has pursued its drab all *american course 
Individual senators with an eye to the voters back home occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan soft shell crabs from Maryland oysters from Washington grapefruit from Florida 
But plain old bean soup served daily since the turn of the century  at the insistence of the late Sen Fred Dubois of Idaho  made clear to the citizenry that the Senate's stomach was in the right place 
In a daring stroke the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10 000 per year French born maitre d'hotel 
Holders of toll road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes 
Long term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward 
Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues 
Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative 
Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll road bonds 
Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing 
That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates 
As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes investors who bought toll road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments 
Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax exempt bonds 
Other tax exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 according to Standard & Poor's average 
On balance prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then 
However in the same three month period toll road bonds as a group have bucked this trend 
On these bonds price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines 
Tax free returns 
Investors however still see an element of more than ordinary risk in the toll road bonds 
You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page 
Many of the toll road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent or very close to that 
And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to or beyond the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds 
That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds 
It's not much more in fact than the return that is offered on U S Treasury bonds 
For investors whose income is taxed at high rates though a tax free yield of 4 per cent is high 
It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16 000 of income to be taxed or for a married couple with more than $32 000 of taxed income 
Swelling traffic 
A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12 month period  ending in February or March  shows what is happening 
The report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company investment bankers 
Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period 
And there is the bright note  the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession 
Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter 
Indication  the long term trend of turnpike traffic is upward 
Look for example at the Ohio Turnpike 
Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February as compared with those same months in 1960 
Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues  after operating costs 
As a result the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds 
That was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months 
That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike 
Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 but up for the 12 months ending in March 
Costs were held down despite a bitter winter 
For the year the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs against 121 per cent in the preceding period 
The road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston 
Slow successes 
Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do 
The 187 mile Illinois State Toll Highway for example was not opened over its entire length until December 1958 
In the 12 months ended in February 1960 the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load  with the remainder paid out of initial reserves 
In the 12 months ended in February 1961 this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest 
That improvement is continuing 
In the first two months of 1961 earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 
Success for many turnpikes has come hard 
Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates 
In these cases the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll rate increases or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways 
Many rate increases already have been put into effect 
Higher tolls are planned for July 1 1961 on the Richmond *petersburg Va  Turnpike and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study 
Easier access 
Progress is being made too in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes 
The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration 
Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb 28 1961 
Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City Kans  and Kansas City Mo 
Meanwhile there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years 
For some roads troubles 
Investors studying the toll road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals 
Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike 
If nothing is done the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 
West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months and despite recent improvement in revenues holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same 
These however are exceptions 
The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement 
It's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll road bonds will pay out in full 
Already however several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins 
Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break even point 
A top American official after a look at Europe's factories thinks the U *s is in a very serious situation competitively 
Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges accompanied by a member of our staff on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy's biggest companies  Fiat the auto producer and Olivetti maker of typewriters and calculating machines 
Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows  follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant and you learn this  one modern equipment  much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan  enables Fiat to turn out 2 100 cars a day 
About half of these are exported 
Two wage costs are a fraction of the U *s costs 
A skilled worker on the assembly line for example earns $37 a week 
Three labor troubles are infrequent 
Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years 
Said Secretary Hodges  it's a tough combination for the U *s to face 
Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges 
Olivetti took over Underwood the U *s typewriter maker in late 1959 
Within a year without reducing wages Underwood's production costs were cut one third prices were slashed 
The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled 
The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout modern machinery 
The firm is design conscious sales conscious advertising conscious 
Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U *s 
The inflow of foreign capital would help the U *s balance of payments 
Hodges predicted  I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U *s 
There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas 
Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports 
The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines 
Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these  an international conference of the big textile importing and textile exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy 
Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting 
The U *s will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less developed countries over the years 
Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to get on their feet 
If they have trouble exporting international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would 
Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible 
At the same time another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low wage countries to control textile exports  especially dumping of specific products  to high wage textile producing countries 
Japan since 1957 has been voluntarily curbing exports of textiles to the U *s 
Hong Kong India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the Lancashire Pact 
None of these countries is happy with these arrangements 
The Japanese want to increase exports to the U *s while they have been curbing shipments they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U *s market 
Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly 
The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons 
The Kennedy hope is that at the conference or through bilateral talks the low wage textile producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that dumping practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas 
Gradual controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants 
This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products 
It's an important clue to Washington thinking 
Note too that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U *s textile industry 
Get competitive or get out 
In veiled terms that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry 
The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines where modernization doesn't seem feasible 
Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed 
Government research will look into new products and methods 
Import quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved 
But the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import quotas 
Rather they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing  and helping  the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products 
What's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low wage countries 
Among the highest paid workers in the world are U *s coal miners 
Yet U *s coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water 
Steel Company of Wales a British steelmaker wants to bring in Virginia coal cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively  especially in foreign markets 
Virginia coal delivered by ship in Wales will be about $2 80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines 
U *s coal is cheap despite high wages because of widespread mechanization of mines wide coal seams attactive rates on ocean freight 
Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting narrow and very deep 
Productivity of U *s miners is twice that of the British 
Welsh coal miners Communist led are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coal 
They threaten to strike 
The British Government will have to decide whether to let U *s coal in 
The British coal industry is unprofitable has large coal stocks it can't sell 
Every library borrower or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five cent fiction rentals knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically I'm sorry but we don't have that book 
There wouldn't be much demand for it I'm afraid 
Behind this reply and its many variations is the ever present budget problem all libraries must face from the largest to the smallest 
What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15 000 book titles 
What to buy for adult and child readers for lovers of fiction and nonfiction for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified when your budget is pitifully small 
Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate 
A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually which includes the librarian's salary and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs  this in the world's richest city 
The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse 
Confronted with this situation most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds 
In some parts of the country however a co operative movement has begun to grow under the wing of state governments whereby with the financial help of the state libraries share their book resources on a county wide or regional basis 
New York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co operative systems so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow 
Because it is so large a state with marked contrasts in population density the organization of the New York co operative offers a cross section of how the plan works 
At one extreme are the systems of upper New York State where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large sparsely populated area 
At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System in a high density area with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve 
Both these types and those in between are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state 
It was a step in the right direction but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today 
Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts 
An earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not as they saw fit 
Some library boards are wary of the plan 
A large well stocked library surrounded in a county by smaller ones may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great 
A small library may cherish its independence and established ways and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board 
Within a system however the autonomy of each member library is preserved 
The local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program facilities and services but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system 
All services are given without cost to members 
So obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day not too distant when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co op 
To set up a co operative library system the law requires a central book collection of 100 000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus and the system is organized around it 
The collection may be in an existing library or it may be built up in a central collection 
Each system develops differently according to the area it serves but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency 
The basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita if a library spends a certain number of dollars 
In Nassau County for example the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons a figure that has doubled since 1950 
This system by virtue of its variety and size offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation 
The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area 
The need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries adequate to satisfy everyday needs could afford 
Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters which will reach its goal of 100 000 volumes by 1965 
The major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers 
Basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection but there is also specialization in science and technology an indicated weakness in local libraries 
On microfilm headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day as well as bound volumes of important periodicals 
The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans 
Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day 
It is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide 
The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries 
Each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area which headquarters could then build upon 
East Meadow has philosophy psychology and religion  Freeport houses social science pure science and language  history biography and education are centered in Hempstead  Levittown has applied science business and literature  while Hewlett *woodmere is the repository of art music and foreign languages 
The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service 
This kind of cooperation is not wholly new of course 
Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter century but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis 
Local libraries find too that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library 
The system passes on these savings to its members 
Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing 
Books are not the only resource of the system 
Schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary art and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs and to organizations in member communities 
The most recent film catalogue available at each library lists 110 titles presently in the collection any of which may be borrowed without charge 
This catalogue lists separately films suitable for children young adults or adults although some classics cut across age groups such as Nanook Of The North The Emperor's Nightingale and The Red Balloon 
Workshops are conducted by the system's audio visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries teaching them the effective use of film as a library service 
The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together  consequently an experienced children's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well planned library activities cooperating with the children's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences workshops and frequent visits 
Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book review and book selection center to provide better methods of purchasing and selection 
Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups 
Story hours pre school programs activities with community agencies and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children's consultant 
Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days threatening to expand beyond its boundaries 
In addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county  it prepares cooperative displays  posters booklists brochures and other promotional material  for use in member libraries  it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used  and it publishes Sum And Substance a monthly newsletter which reports the system's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries 
The system itself is governed by a board of trustees geographically representing its membership 
In Nassau as in other systems the long range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools and on adult education in general 
Librarians a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication can begin to see results today 
Library use is multiplying daily and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans the teen agers 
To them especially the librarians with the help of co ops hope they will never have to say I'm sorry we don't have that book 
Today more than ever before the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned 
The great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western world 
The need for lifetime reading is apparent 
Education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives for it is only through knowledge that we as a nation can cope with the dangers that threaten our society 
The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life 
We cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read  if we are not discriminating in our reading  if we do not know how to use what we do read 
We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word 
A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries 
Although progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed America 
The problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word continue to expand 
The inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition 
There are for example approximately 25 000 000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50 000 000 with inadequate service 
In college libraries 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1 509 institutions surveyed last year by the U *s Office of Education 
And over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all 
In every aspect of service  to the public to children in schools to colleges and universities  the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services 
Only public understanding and support can provide that service 
This is one of the main reasons for National Library Week April 16 22 and for its theme  for a richer fuller life read ] assembly session brought much good the General Assembly which adjourns today has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened 
It was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education 
There followed the historic appropriations and budget fight in which the General Assembly decided to tackle executive powers 
The final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need 
Long range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis to crisis government 
This session for instance may have insured a financial crisis two years from now 
In all the turmoil some good legislation was passed 
Some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action 
Certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law the school bills the increase in teacher pensions the ban on drag racing acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue 
No action has been taken however on such major problems as ending the fee system penal reform modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales 
Only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state 
The legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions 
Fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in the past have made Georgia look like anything but the empire state of the South 
We congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation 
In the interim between now and next year we trust the House and Senate will put their minds to studying Georgia's very real economic fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics 
League regularly stands on the side of right the League of Women Voters 40 now and admitting it proudly is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive 
It's a good use of money 
These women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to Thomas Jefferson's dictum that one must cherish the people's spirit but keep alive their attention 
If once they become inattentive to the public affairs Jefferson said you and I and Congress and assemblies judges and governors shall all become wolves 
Newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs 
The league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public 
The harder the choice the more willing the league is to wade in 
And the league takes a stand with great regularity on the side of right 
Look to Coosa Valley for industrial progress cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest Georgia counties that are members of the Coosa Valley Area Planning and Development Commission 
Coupling its own budget of $83 750 with a $30 000 state grant authorized by Gov Vandiver the group expects to sign a contract in March with Georgia Tech 
Then a full time planning office will be established in Rome to work with a five member Georgia Tech research staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program 
The undertaking has abundant promise 
It recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an area wide effort better results can be accomplished than through the go it alone approach 
Rusk idea strengthens United States defense the Rusk belief in balanced defense replacing the Dulles theory of massive retaliation removes a grave danger that has existed 
The danger lay not in believing that our own *j would deter Russia's use of hers  that theory was and is sound 
The danger lay in the American delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough 
By limiting American strength too much to nuclear strength this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war 
This strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war 
It also weakened our diplomatic stance because Russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity 
This left the Soviets plenty of leeway to start low grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity 
By maintaining the nuclear deterrent but gearing American military forces to fight conventional wars too Secretary of State Rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position 
De*kalb budget shows county is on beam De*kalb's budget for 1961 is a record one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance 
It includes a raise in the county minimum wage creation of several new jobs at the executive level financing of beefed up industrial development efforts and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare fire protection sanitation and road maintenance 
That such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners headed by Chairman Charles O Emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed and other county officials 
Somewhere somebody is bound to love us G Mennen Williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly

Chin up Soapy 
Power company backs confidence with dollars confidence in the state's economic future is reflected in the Georgia Power Company's record construction budget for this year 
The firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning 
It is good to know that Georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization 
Georgia's mental health program received a badly needed boost from the General Assembly in the form of a $1 750 000 budget increase for the Milledgeville State Hospital 
Actually it amounts to $1 250 000 above what the institution already is receiving considering the additional half million dollars Gov Vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus 
Either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is 
But exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so much that needs doing 
The practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished 
The work week of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be reduced 
More attendants nurses and doctors should be hired 
Patients deserve more attention than they are getting 
Even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year Georgia will be spending only around $3 15 per day per patient 
The national average is more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low 
Kansas regarded as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill spends $9 per day per patient 
Georgia has made some reforms true 
The intensive treatment program is working well 
But in so many other areas we still are dragging 
Considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted 
The boost is helpful but inadequate 
The end of Trujillo assassination even of a tyrant is repulsive to men of good conscience 
Rafael Trujillo the often blood thirsty dictator of the Dominican Republic for 31 years perhaps deserved his fate in an even handed appraisal of history 
But whether the murder of El Benefactor in Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people of the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered 
Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination 
The responsibility for scores of deaths including the abduction and murder of Jesus Maria Galindez a professor at Columbia University in New York has been laid at his door 
He had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela 
It was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the Venezuelan government reportedly involving the use of Dominican arms by former Venezuelan Dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez has been uncovered and quashed 
The recent history of the Dominican Republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive 
Unquestionably Trujillo did some good things for his country  he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably 
But the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition 
El Benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth 
The jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure 
He maintained amply financed lobbies in the United States and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise and his influence extended even to Congress 
Until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the United States had been an article of faith with Trujillo and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character 
Tardily the Government here came to understand how this country's own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression 
Last year after Trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean the United States and many other members of the Organization of American States broke diplomatic relations with him 
Thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines 
Trujillo's dictatorship had been along conservative right wing lines 
But after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing Communist slogans 
There was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with Castro in Cuba previously a bete noire to Trujillo  thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces 
What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle 
The Dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation and all alternative leadership has been suppressed 
Perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger 
The Dominican Republic could turn toward Communist type authoritarianism as easily as toward Western freedom 
Such a twist would be a tragedy for the Dominican people who deserve to breathe without fear 
For that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the Dominican Republic will need the greatest sympathy and help 
Start on rapid transit high speed buses on the George Washington Memorial Parkway operating between downtown Washington and Cabin John Glen Echo and Brookmont would constitute an alluring sample of what the new National Capital Transportation Agency can do for this city 
In presenting plans for such express buses before the Montgomery County Council the administrator of the *j C Darwin Stolzenbach was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching 
Such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the *j are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area 
Because the buses would not stop on the parkway land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed 
The *j is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of Congress 
Must Berlin remain divided 
The inference has been too widely accepted that because the Communists have succeeded in building barricades across Berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city 
So far as the record is concerned the Western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so 
Though Walter Ulbricht by grace of Soviet tanks may be head man in East Germany that does not give him any right to usurp the government of East Berlin or to absorb that semi city into the Soviet zone 
The wartime protocol of September 12 1944 designated a special Greater Berlin area comprising the entire city to be under joint occupation 
It was not a part of any one of the three  later four  zones for occupation by Soviet American British and French troops respectively 
After the Berlin blockade and airlift the Council of Foreign Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of Germany and of Berlin 
For some time the Communists honored the distinction between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector of Berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas 
Then they moved offices of the East German puppet government into East Berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East Germany 
That this and the closing of the East Berlin *west Berlin border have not been accepted by the Western governments appears in notes which Britain France and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter's gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer and other West German officials to West Berlin 
The Chancellor had as much business there as Ulbricht had in East Berlin  and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound truck taunts of Gerhard Eisler 
The British and other replies to that Moscow note pointed out efforts of the Communist authorities to integrate East Berlin into East Germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of East Germany 
They insisted on the fundamental fact that the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite status 
This is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact 
There remains of course the question of what the West can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts 
One ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into West Berlin as Communist vopos try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents 
Another remained when an American Army car was recovered but with a broken glass 
The glass may seem trivial but Communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed 
Remembering the step by step fate of Danzig and the West German misgivings about salami tactics it is to be hoped that the dispatch of General Clay to West Berlin as President Kennedy's representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed 
Prairie National Park thousands of buffalo  bison they will never be to the man on the street  grazing like a mobile brown throw rug upon the rolling dusty green grassland 
A horizon even and seamless binding the vast sun bleached dome of sky to earth 
That picture of the American prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the American continent as any later cinema image of the West made in live oak canyons near Hollywood 
For it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of Americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the Ohio and Mississippi valleys began to fill 
The National Park Service now proposes to preserve an area in Pottawatomie County northeast Kansas as a Prairie National Park 
There the buffalo would roam to be seen as a tapestry not as moth eaten zoo specimens 
Wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved 
Grasslands would extend unfenced unplowed unbroken by silo or barn  as the first settlers saw them 
The Park Service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park 
American history should clinch the case when Congress is asked to approve 
Whisky on the air a Philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hard liquor advertising on *j and radio 
Starting with small stations not members of the National Association of Broadcasters the firm apparently is seeking to break down the anti liquor barriers in major market stations 
Probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the Federal Communications Commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power 
The National Association of Broadcasters code specifically bars hard liquor commercials 
Past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy 
Even the Distilled Spirits Institute has long had a specific prohibition 
Why then with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads is it necessary to seek congressional action 
Simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the Distilled Spirits Institute and of radio and *j stations that are not members of the *j tends to spread 
Soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non code competitors 
Although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudo sophistication with which *j soft drinks are downed or toothpaste applied there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie *cola and gulling him into downing bourbon 
A law is needed 
New York  Democrats' choice registered Democrats in New York City this year have the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for Mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization 
In the central contest that for Mayor they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other 
Mayor Robert F Wagner must as his opponents demand assume responsibility for his performance in office 
While all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the Wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools law enforcement and fiscal policies 
The Mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record 
State Controller Arthur Levitt on the other hand cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the city's welfare 
They too have links with the city's ills 
Both men are known to be honest and public spirited 
Mayor Wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of Mr Levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post 
As Mayor Mr Levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like 
His election on the other hand would unquestionably strengthen the regulars 
Mr Wagner might or might not be a new Mayor in this third term now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls bosses 
These are of course the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote 
But his reelection would strengthen the liberal Democrats and the labor unions who back him 
If this choice is less exciting than New York Democrats may wish it nevertheless must be made 
The vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party 
Little war big test both Mr *j have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over Laos 
President Kennedy already two quiet demands down still refused Thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to Moscow 
But at the same time he moved his helicopter borne marines to within an hour of the fighting 
And Secretary Rusk en route to Bangkok doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of Australian or Thai *j forces 
For Mr Kennedy speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation 
The new President is in no position to start out his dealings with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs 
He must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says 
In this case he has put the alternatives clearly to Mr Khrushchev for the third time 
At his press conference Mr Kennedy said all we want in Laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn 
At the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position 
Since Laos is of no more purely military value to Moscow itself than it is to Washington this approach might be expected to head off Mr Khrushchev for the moment 
But because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in Laos the Soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride  a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot but would bog Washington in a tactical mess 
As wars go Laos is an extremely little one 
Casualties have been running about a dozen men a day 
The hard core of the pro *communist rebel force numbers only some 2 000 tough Viet Minh guerrilla fighters 
But for the United States and its *j allies to attempt to shore up a less tough less combat tested government army in monsoon shrouded road shy guerrilla th' wisp terrain is a risk not savored by Pentagon planners 
But if anything can bring home to Mr Khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this Braddock against the *indiansjj contest it will probably be the fact that *j forces are ready to attempt it  plus the fact that Moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with Washington 
Fortunately both the Republicans and America's chief Western allies now are joined behind the neutral Laos aim of the President 
Actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the British policy of seeking to achieve a neutral Laos via the international bargaining table 
It is ironic that Washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable 
The State Department tacitly rejected the neutral Laos idea after the Geneva conference of 1954 and last year Washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma 
But since last fall the United States has been moving toward a pro neutralist position and now is ready to back the British plan for a cease fire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers 
The road to a guaranteed neutral coup proof Laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's terrain 
But for the safety of Southeast Asia and for the sake of the Laotian people  who would not be well ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting  this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made 
The world awaits Mr Khrushchev's choice of alternatives 
A vote for educational *j the Senate's overwhelming  64 13  vote to support locally controlled educational *j efforts should be emulated in the lower house 
Twice previously the Senate has approved measures backing *j and the House has let them die 
But this year prospects may be better 
The House communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds 
This year's Senate measure would provide each state and the District of Columbia with $1 000 000 to be used in support of private state or municipal *j efforts 
The funds would be used for equipment not for land buildings or operation 
The relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value 
But lacking money from commercial sponsors the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service 
Other communities  the ones to be aided most by the Senate bill  have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment 
A good man departs 
Goodby Mr Sam 
Sam Rayburn was a good man a good American and third a good Democrat 
He was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure  Mr Speaker Mr Sam and Mr Democrat at one and the same time 
The House was his habitat and there he flourished first as a young representative then as a forceful committee chairman and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth Speaker of the House and second most powerful man in Washington 
Mr Rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label 
He was no flaming liberal yet the New Deal the Fair Deal and the New Frontier needed him 
He was not a rear looking conservative yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any 
Two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word 
Sam Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave for he was never loquacious and his word once given was not subject to retraction 
It might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs 
The demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical 
His leadership was not for audiences 
A growl a nod was usually enough 
When it was not one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented 
He would rise in the well of the House his chin upon his chest his hands gripping the side of a desk and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence 
He spoke briefly sensibly to the point and without oratorical flourishes 
He made good plain American common sense and the House usually recognized it and acted upon it 
These public efforts were rare because Mr Rayburn normally did his counseling persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the House floor 
He expected Democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them 
With his long service he had a long memory an excellent thing in a political leader 
He was of course in the House for a very long time 
There are only two men remaining in Congress who with Rayburn voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917 
To almost two generations of Americans it must have seemed as though the existence of Mr Sam coincided with that of the House 
And it was the House he loved 
To be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition 
The Senate to him was not the upper body and he corrected those who said he served under the president 
He served with him 
Sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death 
Woodrow Wilson with whom he began his years in Washington Warren G Harding Calvin Coolidge *j with whom he managed a social revolution 
And those still with us Herbert C Hoover Harry S Truman Dwight D Eisenhower and John F Kennedy 
He was a fighter for those of his own party 
Mr Truman has only to recall the hopeless campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of Mr Kennedy with Congress would have been sadder than it was had not Mr Sam been there 
As it was his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration 
With Republican presidents he fought fair 
He was his own man not an automatic obstructionist 
He kept his attacks on Republicanism for partisan campaigns but that is part of the game he was born to play 
Under any name  Mr Speaker Mr Democrat Mr Sam  he was a good man 
*j off the Congo track thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve the cause of peace under the United Nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends 
In 18 months no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle 
Simply out of bloodlust their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river 
The excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries 
In other words atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned had the victims been serving the cause of dissident Katanga 
Does this suggest that the Congo is fit for nationhood or that *j is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it 
To the contrary through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence 
Mass rapes troop mutinies uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures given no sanction by any political authority have become almost daily occurrences 
Yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of Katanga 
It happens in the territory of the Leopoldville government which is itself a fiction demonstrably incapable of governing and commanding only such limited credit abroad as *j support gives it 
The main question raised by the incident is how much longer will *j bury its head in the sand on the Congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms 
The probable answer is that it will do so just as long as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on Central Africa 
Right now they are pushing a resolution which would have *j use its forces to invade and subjugate Katanga 
That notion is fantastically wrong headed from several points of view 
The *j army is too weak too demoralized for the task 
Further it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned 
Last it makes no sense to deliver Katanga the one reasonably solid territory into the existing chaos 
The Congo should have been mandated because it was not ready for independence 
The idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom 
It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism 
But if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General Assembly it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach 
Otherwise *j will march blindly on to certain defeat 
Featherbed reversal a recent editorial discussing a labor management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific Co and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information 
The editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year 
Our comment was that this was featherbedding in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement 
The statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life 
Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need 
Also normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic 
The situation with regard to the Southern Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries 
The solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands 
Meditations from a fallout shelter time was when the house of delegates of the American Bar association leaned to the common sense side 
But the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar and when the lads met in St Louis it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United Nations was scarcely less than wonderful despite an imperfection here and there 
It was the brief writers decided man's best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world 
Peace it's wonderful and world law it's wonderful too and shouldn't we get an international covenant extending it into space before the Russians put some claim jumper on the moon 
Meanwhile in Moscow Khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of *j to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice of surrendering West Berlin to communism 
A nuclear pacifier of these dimensions  roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the United States has triggered experimentally  would certainly produce a bigger bang and just for kicks Khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St Louis to the moon where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink 
While he was at it the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide 
Fools he bayed what do you think you are doing 
The only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort 
Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking of an American plane by a demented Algerian with a gun 
The craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to Havana where for some unknown reason Castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian foreign minister a passenger who is not an admirer of old Ten O'*clock Shadow 
The plane was sent back to the United States for a change but Castro kept the crazy gunman who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution 
Less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by Castro's right hand man Che Guevara who edified the Inter *american Economic and Social council meeting in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined from the United States embassy at Caracas Venezuela 
The contents were highly embarrassing to American spokesmen who were on hand to promise Latin Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium 
Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing American diplomatic papers and planes but the Kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that but for its own incompetence in protecting American interests these things would not happen 
The same can be said about the half hearted Cuban invasion mounted by the administration last April which we trust is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious Khrushchev 
Pass the iron rations please and light another candle for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away 
The customer loses again 
The board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain as they had planned to do this month 
The request for lower rates originated with the Southern railway which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100 ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional smaller car 
By reducing rates as much as 60 per cent it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines 
The board's action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws 
A shock wave from Africa word of Dag Hammarskjold's death in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe 
As head of the United Nations he was the symbol of world peace and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously 
It was on the eve of a momentous U *n session to come to grips with cold war issues 
His firm hand will be desperately missed 
Mr Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace 
He had sought talks with Moise Tshombe the secessionist president of Congo's Katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody 
He earnestly urged a cease fire 
The story of the fatal crash is not fully known 
The U *n chartered plane which was flying from the conference city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired 
Whether this or overt action was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined 
The death of Mr Hammarskjold removes the United Nations' most controversial leader 
He was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice 
He courageously defended the rights of small nations and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the Communist bloc 
The Congo in whose cause he died was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs 
His policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape 
When the recent Katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions Mr Hammarskjold despite the danger flew to exert a calming influence 
He gave his life for his beliefs 
The U *n session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing 
It is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments 
If the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason and justice 
That is the hope of mankind 
Monument to togetherness reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of Greater Miami's hardest tasks 
Too many have bogged down in bickering 
Even when public bodies arrived at a consensus at least one dissenting vote has been usual 
So we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity 
All nine members of the Inter *american Center Authority voted for Goodbody & Company's proposal to finance the long awaited trade and cultural center 
The widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms of its contract 
If the indenture is accepted the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue 
Then Goodbody will hand over a minimum of $15 5 million for developing the spacious Graves Tract to house the center 
The next step awaits approval today by the Metro commissioners as the members of the Dade County Port Authority 
They allotted $500 000 three years ago to support Interama until its own financing could be arranged 
Less than half the sum has been spent since the Interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations 
The balance is being budgeted for the coming year 
Unanimity on Interama is not surprising 
It is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed 
The City of Miami recently yielded a prior claim of $8 5 million on the Graves Tract to clear the way for the project 
County officials have cooperated consistently 
So have the people's elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels 
Interama as it rises will be a living monument to Greater Miami's ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises 
A short report and a good one progress or lack of it toward civil rights in the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689 page compilation issued last week by the United States Commission on Civil Rights 
Much happened in this field during the past 12 months 
Each state advisory committee documented its own activity 
Some accounts are quite lengthy but Florida's is the shortest of all requiring only four paragraphs 
The established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas reported this group headed by Harold Colee of Jacksonville and including two South Floridians William D Singer and John B Turner of Miami 
No complaints or charges have been filed during the past year either verbally or written from any individual or group 
The committee continues to feel that Florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights 
Problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint 
The progress reported by the advisory committee is real 
While some think we move too fast and others too slowly Florida's record is a good one and stands out among the 50 
West Germany remains Western West Germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead on Berlin and unification with a coalition government 
This is the key fact emerging from Sunday's national election 
Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic Party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957 
In order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength 
Inevitably this means some compromise 
The aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired 
Both Willy Brandt's Social Democrats who gained 22 seats in the new parliament and the Free Democrats who picked up 23 will insist on that before they enter the government 
Moon faced Ludwig Erhart the economic expert probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him 
If he becomes chancellor Dr Erhart would make few changes 
The wizard who fashioned West Germany's astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise 
He is dedicated to building the nation's strength and as are all West Germans to a free Berlin and to reunion with captive East Germany 
What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result 
If the party of Adenauer and Erhart with 45 per cent of the vote approaches the party of Willy Brandt which won 36 per cent the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve 
West Berlin's Mayor Brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it 
The Free Democrats  12 per cent of the vote  believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the Soviet Union and more dealings with the Communist bloc 
The question left by the election is whether West Germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility 
It could go either way since the gains for both points of view were about the same 
Regardless of the decision two facts are clear 
West Germany with its industrial and military might reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations 
And the career of Konrad Adenauer who upheld Germany's tradition of rock like leaders which Bismarck began draws near the end 
Better ask before joining Americans are a nation of joiners a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing 
But it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't want to make a spectacle of himself 
For instance so called conservative organizations some of them secret are sprouting in the garden of joining where liberal organizations once took root 
One specific example is a secret fraternity which will coordinate anti *communist efforts 
The principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled 
According to The Chicago Tribune News Service State Atty Gen Stanley Mosk of California has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name  1 
Does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations 
2 
Does it attack other traditional American institutions with unsupportable and wild charges 
3 
Does it put the label of un *american or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically 
4 
Does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming American statesmen for wars Communism depression and other troubles of the world 
5 
Does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns 
6 
Do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate 
In some instances a seventh question can be added  7 
Does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government political party or personality in opposition or preference to the American system 
If the would be joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of Americans in a troubled time 
Falling somewhere in a category between Einstein's theory and sand fleas  difficult to see but undeniably there nevertheless  is the tropical green city of Islandia a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents limited access and an unlimited future 
The latter is what concerns us all 
Whatever land you can see here from the North tip end of Elliott Key looking southward belongs to someone  people who have title to the land 
And what you can't see the land underneath the water belongs to someone too 
The public 
The only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment 
In the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours 
In this instance happily insistence is being made that our share is protected 
And until this protection is at least as concrete as say the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at Miami Beach those who represent us all should agree to nothing 
Closed doors in city hall the reaction of certain City Council members to California's newest anti secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing 
We had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide and therefore had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public 
In the preamble to the open meeting statutes collectively known as the Brown Act the Legislature declares that the public commissions boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business 
It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly 
The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them 
The people in delegating authority do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know 
The full implementation of these noble words however has taken the efforts of five sessions of the Legislature 
Since 1953 California has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted but not until this year did the lawmakers in Sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the Brown Act 
Despite the lip service paid by local governments the anti secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations 
When all else fails it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations 
We submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law  and one of its principal aims 
Without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily 
But the citizens would of course never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious 
Help when needed if the Dominican Republic achieves free democratic government it will be due in large part to the U *s show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship 
Outwardly Ciudad Trujillo is calm 
None of the Trujillo family remains 
Mr Balaguer is in control and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring 
Had U *s warships not appeared off the Dominican coast there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war 
Ultimately either the Trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro in Cuba 
Within the Organization of American States there may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention which was not without risk obviously 
But there was no complaint from the Dominican crowds which lined Ciudad Trujillo's waterfront shouting vive Yankees ] more the U *s action was hailed by a principal opposition leader Dr Juan Bosch as having saved many lives and many troubles in the near future 
Mr Balaguer's troubles are by no means over 
He will need the help of all *j members to eradicate finally the forces of authoritarianism pro *trujillo and pro *castro alike 
In cooperating toward that objective *j might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the United States 
Matter of survival those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935 
Now as then it is a matter of jobs 
Craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim such as factory maintenance 
The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the American Federation of Labor of its industrial union members 
That breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations 
Or that's what it looked like at the time 
But automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs 
Walter Reuther leader of the industrial union faction of the *j says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all American labor 
Whether it could be as disastrous for American labor as say Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters is a matter of conjecture 
But the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor 
Engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival this country can have little patience with labor's family feuds 
The concept of labor as a special class is outmoded and in the task confronting America as bastion of the free world labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive 
Deterrent the Army Navy and Air Force among others may question Secretary Freeman's claim that the high estate of United States agriculture is the strongest deterrent to the spread of communism 
But the secretary insists that the success of the American farmer is the greatest single source of strength in the struggle to insure freedom around the world 
Mr Freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by America's capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production  or even by the Soviet's successes in space 
This shouldn't surprise the secretary  American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long long time 
In fact over the years the American farmer's capacity to over produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar 
And thus far Mr Freeman has offered very little relief 
The 1961 feed grain program which the secretary sponsored has been declared a billion dollar fiasco 
In exchange for higher price supports growers pledged reduction in planted acreage 
But the farmers outsmarted Washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer 
The result  $1 1 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget 
Perhaps as Mr Freeman says American agriculture may stop the Communists but it is also swindling the American taxpayer 
What's wrong at state a senate subcommittee headed by Sen Jackson of Washington has been going over the State Department and has reached some predictable conclusions 
The department needs a clearer sense of direction at the top and it needs fewer but better people Sen Jackson says 
The subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department 
President Kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance 
But those who would revitalize so complex an organization must first of all overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes 
Nor does Sen Jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the White House of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy 
This tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates 
But competent observers believe he is making progress particularly toward what Sen Jackson lists as the primary need  a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them 
The Jackson report will provide some of the political support Mr Rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged as Sen Jackson puts it in work that does not really need doing 
Mr Rusk should also draw comfort from Sen Jackson's recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved 
Self criticism is a rare but needed commodity in Congress 
Betting men forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist 
But now apparently the job of Secretary of Labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends 
James P Mitchell when he was the head of the department promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below three million a couple of years ago 
He lost but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora 
His successor Secretary Goldberg also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months 
No betting man Mr Goldberg says he's merely putting my neck out again by predicting the rate will go down this month 
He is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride  a new record high in personal income an increase in housing starts a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods 
Mr Mitchell had an excuse for losing  the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated 
Mr Goldberg has less reason for missing 
The economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they can't be blamed in November 
The odds thus appear favorable that the secretary's neck may be spared 
Little resistance Cambodia's chief of state who has been accused of harboring Communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring South Viet Nam and Thailand insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in Southeast Asia 
But so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is Prince Sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel 
I have to see the facts is the way the prince puts it 
And from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro *western posture 
Prince Sihanouk's powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions 
Bottom sighted Commerce Secretary Hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official Washington's economic forecasters 
Weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the Cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement 
Recently Treasury Secretary Dillon and Labor Secretary Goldberg fell into line with Mr Hodges' appraisal though there has been some reluctance to do so at the White House 
And now Mr Hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point 
He is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump 
The secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales 
February's volume was 1 per cent above January's for the first pickup since last October although it's still 1 5 per cent off from February 1960 
Corroborating Mr Hodges' figures was the Federal Reserve Board's report of the large sales increase in the nation's department stores for the week ending March 4 
In Newark for example this gain was put at 26 per cent above the year earlier level 
Of course some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that Easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960 
Another optimistic sign this one from the Labor Department was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments was interrupted for the first time in the week ending Feb 25 
Initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8 100 in the week ending March 4 
Mr Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes 
Well we can't have everything 
Prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut 
In New Jersey too New Jersey folk need not be told of the builder's march to the sea for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain 
Now the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons is threatened but the battlefront extends far beyond our state 
Against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of Cape Cod shoreline the tiny tract at Stone Harbor may seem unimportant 
But Interior Secretary Udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves 
The move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30 000 acres of Cape Cod from Provincetown to Chatham is strengthened by President Kennedy's interest in that area 
But preservation of the natural beauty of the Cape is of more than regional concern for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country 
By comparison Stone Harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable for aside from the Audubon Society they are mostly the snowy common and cattle egrets and the Louisiana green little blue and black crowned herons who nest and feed there 
But there is hope for Conservation Commissioner Bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space 
The desirability of preserving such places as the Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year 
Public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing 
But that heritage is shrinking even faster 
No joyride much of the glamor President Kennedy's Peace Corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by Sargent Shriver the head corpsman 
Anybody who is expecting a joyride should according to Mr Shriver get off the train right now 
First of all the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling 
It will be a 16 hour training day 
Then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet culture language and living conditions will be different 
And the pay of course will be nil 
Despite all this the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else 
The study of the St Louis area's economic prospects prepared for the Construction Industry Joint Conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan St Louis Survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the Missouri *illinois countryside 
St Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow growing and in some places stagnant mid continent region 
Slackened regional demand for St Louis goods and services reflects the region's relative lack of purchasing power 
Not all St Louis industries of course have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood 
But for those which do the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core 
The city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate Missouri and Southern Illinois 
Gov Dalton's New Commerce and Industry Commission is moving to create a nine state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry 
That is one approach 
Another would be to take the advice of Dr Elmer Ellis president of the University of Missouri and provide for an impartial professional analysis of Missouri's economy 
He says the state in order to proceed with economic development must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy 
The research center of the University's School of Business and Public Administration is prepared to undertake the analysis Dr Ellis has been talking about 
He and Dean John W Schwada of the Business School outlined the project at a recent conference 
The University can make a valuable contribution to the state's economic development through such a study 
In Southern Illinois the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth 
The Carbondale Industrial Development Corp has obtained a $500 000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs 
Carbondale is in the Herrin *murphysboro *west Frankfort labor market where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average 
The Federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on Missouri's depressed areas and in the long run that will benefit St Louis as well 
Politics ridden St Clair county in Illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development 
More industrial acreage lies vacant in St Clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the St Louis area 
The unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the East Side 
And then there is St Louis county where the Democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth 
St Louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform and permitted parochial interests to take priority over area wide interests 
Some plant location specialists take these signs to mean St Louis county doesn't want industry and so they avoid the area and more jobs are lost 
Metropolitan St Louis's relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political business civic and other leaders on both sides of the Mississippi 
Without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area's economy there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters and St Louis will slip into second class status 
An excess of zeal many of our very best friends are reformers 
Still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far 
Take for example the reformers among New York City's Democrats 
Having whipped Mr De Sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of Tammany Hall they have changed the name to Chatham Hall 
Even though headquarters actually have been moved into the Chatham building do they believe that they can make the new name stick 
Granted that the Tammany name and the Tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame the sachems of the Hall also have a few good marks to their credit 
But it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the Tammany name 
After all it goes back to the days in which sedition was not un *american the days in which the Sons of St Tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence  the British government that is 
Further do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo 
They will  when they give up the donkey and the elephant 
Instead of attempting the impossible why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger's stripes are not black 
That might go over 
The Faget case the White House itself has taken steps to remove a former Batista official Col Mariano Faget from his preposterous position as interrogator of Cuban refugees for the Immigration Service 
The Faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds 
The Kennedy Administration had assured anti *castro Cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of Dictator Batista 
Using a Batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose Castro 
Moreover Col Faget's information on Cuba was too outdated to be useful in screening Castro agents  the Colonel fled to the friendly haven of the Dominican dictatorship as soon as Castro seized power 
And while he had headed Batista's anti *communist section the Batista regime did not disturb the Communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be Communists 
Responsibility for the Faget appointment rests with Gen J M Swing an Eisenhower appointee as head of the Immigration Service 
Gen Swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office 
His official term expired last summer 
Some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend Congressman Walter of Pennsylvania at a moment when the Kennedy Administration was diligently searching for all the House votes it could get 
Congressman Walter has been all powerful in immigration matters but he has announced plans to retire in 1962 
At that point the Administration will have little reason to hang onto Gen Swing 
The Faget case was the kind of salvage job the Administration should not have to repeat 
Mr Eisenhower politician as President Dwight D Eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics 
As a former President however Mr Eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a New York Republican rally and generally missed his target 
Mr Eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a Peace Corps girl in Nigeria to attack the entire Corps as a juvenile experiment and to suggest sending a Corps member to the moon 
This was juvenile ridicule 
Nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad 
His words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding 
The former President blithely ignored recent history in speaking of dollarette dollars under Kennedy Administration fiscal policies 
It was the Eisenhower Administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit 
Finally Mr Eisenhower found nothing but confusion in Washington 
This statement recalls the 1959 Berlin crisis when President Eisenhower first told reporters that Berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too 
The crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded 
Ex *presidents relieved of accountability for policy sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words 
Some of former President Truman's off the cuff discourses have been in that vein 
Nobody can deny the right of former Chief Executives to take part in politics but the American people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility 
This is a matter of respect for the Presidency 
Mr Eisenhower's New York speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship 
Queen of the seas the Queen Mary has long been a symbol of speed luxury and impeccable British service on the high seas 
Reports that the venerable liner which has been in service since 1936 was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us 
But the Cunard line influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment has decided to keep the Queen Mary in service until next Spring at least 
A new queen with the prosaic title of *j had been planned for several years to replace the Queen Mary 
The British government concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry had put through a bill to give Cunard loans and grants totaling $50 400 000 toward the $84 000 000 cost of a new 75 000 ton passenger liner 
Since 1957 more and more trans *atlantic passengers have been crossing by air 
Economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines 
Competition from other steamship lines has cut Cunard's share of sea passengers from one third to one fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the Atlantic run 
The Cunard line has under consideration replacing the Queen Mary with a ship smaller than 75 000 tons 
This would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months 
Also under consideration is an increased investment in Cunard Eagle Airways which has applied to serve New York 
The decline of the Cunard line from its position of dominance in Atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation 
Mission to Viet Nam Gen Maxwell Taylor's statement in Saigon that he is very much encouraged about the chances of the pro *western government of Viet Nam turning back Communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching United States troops to bolster the Vietnamese Army 
Gen Taylor will report to President Kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to South Viet Nam and judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the Far East he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of Vietnamese military economic political and other resources 
There was good reason for Gen Taylor to make an inspection trip at this time 
Communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the Mekong River has interposed a new crisis 
South Viet Nam's rice surplus for next year  more than 300 000 tons  may have been destroyed 
The Viet Cong the Communist rebels may have lost their stored grain and arms factories 
The rebels may try to seize what is left of the October harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in November 
Nothing that is likely to happen however should prompt the sending of United States soldiers for other than instructional missions 
The Indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 when Gen Ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win a war the French were losing 
It is a war to stay out of today especially in view of the fact that President Ngo Dinh Diem apparently does not want United States troops 
He may want additional technical help and this should be forthcoming 
South Viet Nam has received $1 450 000 000 in United States aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since Vice President Lyndon B Johnson's visit last May 
Gen Taylor the President's special military adviser is a level headed officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure 
It is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable and that they will not lead to involving the United States in an Asian morass 
Gov John M Dalton himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the Missouri General Assembly or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained not because of their legal talents but because of their government influence 
The U *n's gravest crisis Ambassador Stevenson yesterday described the U *n 's problem of electing a temporary successor to the late Dag Hammarskjold as the gravest crisis the institution has faced 
Of course it is 
If the decision goes wrong it may be  as Mr Stevenson fears  the first step on the slippery path downhill to a U *n without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning 
The integrity of the office not merely requires that the Secretary General shall be as the Charter puts it the chief administrative officer of the Organization but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority external to the Organization 
In other words the Secretary General is to be a nonpartisan international servant not a political national one 
He should be as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was a citizen of the world 
The Charter does stipulate that due regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible 
The United States and its allies have had no objection to this 
What they have objected to is the attempt of the Russians to make use of the tragedy of Dag Hammarskjold's death to turn the entire U *n staff from the Secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come 
The controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the Secretary General and more particularly around the nature of his relationship with them 
Although the United States and the U *s *s *r have been arguing whether there shall be four five or six top assistants the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work 
If any one of them has any power to veto the Secretary General's decisions the nature of the organization will have changed 
If they give him advice when he asks it or if they perform specified duties under his direction the nature of the U N will not of necessity change 
The Secretary General must have subject to the constitutional direction of the Security Council and the General Assembly the power to act to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone else's instructions 
This is the root issue for which the United States should stand 
We should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography 
What we must have if the United Nations is to survive is as nonpolitical nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it subject to no single nation's direction and subservient to no single nation's ambition 
What the new charter does the new City Charter which should get a Yes vote as Question No 1 on Nov 7 would not make a good Mayor out of a bad one 
There is no such magic in man made laws 
But it would greatly strengthen any Mayor's executive powers remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the Board of Estimate increase his budget making authority both as to expense and capital budgets and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy 
Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the City Council and the Mayor 
Thus there is a clearer division of authority administrative and legislative 
The board is diminished in both respects while it retains control over zoning franchises pier leases sale leasing and assignment of property and other trusteeship functions 
The board will be able to increase decrease add or eliminate budget items subject to the Mayor's veto  but the City Council will now share fully this budget altering power 
Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and Council and a two thirds vote 
The Controller retains his essential fiscal watchdog functions  his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed 
He loses now misplaced tax collection duties which go to the Finance Department 
On net balance in spite of Controller Gerosa's opposition to the new Charter as an invasion of his office the Controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now 
Borough Presidents while retaining membership in the Board of Estimate lose their housekeeping functions 
Highways go to a new Department of Highways sewers to the Department of Public Works such street cleaning as Borough Presidents now do  in Queens and Richmond  to the Sanitation Department 
Some fiscal changes are important 
The expense  operating  budget is to be a program budget and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy  with the Mayor approving  in fund transfers within a department 
The capital budget for construction of permanent improvements becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises  but as a second look safeguard each new project must undergo a Board of Estimate public hearing before construction proceeds 
A road block to desirable local or borough improvements heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected 
This will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business  it will also correct some injustices 
Enlargement of the City Council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow 
Inter american Press the Inter american Press Association which blankets the Western Hemisphere from northern Canada to Cape Horn is meeting in New York City this week for the first time in eleven years 
The I A P A is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere  and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the Cuban revolution 
As the press in Cuba was gradually throttled by the Castro regime more and more Cuban publishers editors and correspondents were forced into exile 
The I A P A found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the Castro Government and the return of the Cuban press to the freedom it knew before Batista's dictatorship began in 1952 
Freedom of the press was lost in Cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances 
In such conditions all freedoms are lost 
This in more diplomatic language is what Adlai Stevenson told the newspaper men of Latin America yesterday on behalf of the United States Government 
He felt able to end on a note of hope 
He sees evidence of fair winds for the ten year Alliance for Progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms 
No group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the Inter *american Press Association 
Meeting in Moscow the Twenty second Soviet Communist Party Congress opens in Moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced 
According to the original program Premier Khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the Kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage  depending upon individual or national politics  because of the bold program for building communism in our time which the Congress will adopt 
But far from being concerned about whether or not Russia will have achieved Utopia by 1980 the world is watching Moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear Armageddon in the immediate future 
The evident contradiction between the rosy picture of Russia's progress painted by the Communist party's program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by Premier Khrushchev's Berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered 
Whether it is or not the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated 
And there must be many Soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980 they and their children must first survive 
This Congress will see Premier Khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years 
The widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among Communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the Congress and the Central Committee it will elect will all have passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job 
Dr Conant's call to action Dr James B Conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer 
His earlier reports considered the American public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change 
Now a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities including New York has shattered this optimism 
Dr Conant has come away shocked and angry 
His new book entitled Slums And Suburbs calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster 
There is room for disagreement concerning some of Dr Conant's specific views 
His strong opposition to the transfer of Negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood in the interest of integration will be attacked by Negro leaders who have fought for and achieved this open or permissive enrollment 
Dr Conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality 
His suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves  even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend 
But these are side issues to a powerful central theme 
That theme cuts through hypocrisies complacency and double talk 
It labels the slums especially the Negro slums as dead end streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters 
The villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters and Dr Conant accuses employers and labor unions alike 
The facts he adds are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools regardless of the color of their students 
A call for action before it is too late has alarming implications when it comes from a man who in his previous reports on the schools cautioned so strongly against extreme measures 
These warnings must not be treated lightly 
Dr Conant's conscientious selfless efforts deserve the nation's gratitude 
He has served in positions of greater glamour both at home and abroad  but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools 
And now  more junk mail a fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so called junk mail 
He was delighted to learn that the Post Office Department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from Representatives in Congress to their constituents without the use of stamps names addresses or even zone numbers 
In accordance with legislation passed at the last session of Congress each Representative is authorized to deliver to the Post Office in bulk newsletters speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district 
This means an added burden to innumerable postmen who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay and it presumably means an increased postal deficit but our correspondent writes think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis 
Our creditors do not forget us letter writing is a dying art 
Occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another but these are mostly typewritten 
Most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter 
Old tired trembling the woman came to the cannery 
She had she said heard that the plant was closing 
It couldn't close she said 
She had raised a calf grown it beef fat 
She had with her own work weary hands put seeds in the ground watched them sprout bud blossom and get ready to bear 
She was ready to kill the beef dress it out and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup broth hash and stew against the winter 
She had done it last year and the year before and the year before that and she and her people were dependent upon these cans for food 
This did not happen in counties of North Georgia where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land 
Nor in South Georgia where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields 
This happened in Decatur De*kalb County not 10 miles from the heart of metropolitian Atlanta 
And now the woman tired and trembling came here to the De*kalb County cannery 
Is it so the cannery is going to close 
O N Moss 61 tall grey as a possum canning plant chief since 1946 didn't know what to say 
He did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer 
He did say he was out of cans the No 3's but I requisitioned 22 000 
He said he had No 2's enough to last two weeks more 
Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one 
A three man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman Charles O Emmerich that the De*kalb County cannery be closed 
Reason  the cannery loses $3 000 yearly 
But De*kalb citizens those who use the facilities of the cannery say the cannery is not supposed to make any money 
The cannery said Mrs Lewellyn Lundeen an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941 to handle the victory garden produce is a service to the taxpayer 
And one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat to plant grow vegetables and put them up 
It helps those people who help themselves 
The county though seems more interested in those people who don't even try those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food 
A driver of a dairy truck who begins work at 1 a m finishes before breakfast then goes out and grows a garden and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five asked what in the world will we do 
What in the world echoed others those come with the beans potatoes the tomatoes will any of us do 
Moss a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county doesn't believe it will close 
But he is in the middle an employe of De*kalb but on the side of the people 
The young married people  the old couples 
The dairy truck driver  the old woman with the stew 
Don't ask me if I think the cannery helps he said 
Sir I know the cannery helps 
Most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard 
When a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say just forget it 
There is one thing I know  a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge 
I know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades 
Several years ago I was his pastor 
One night at the close of the evening service he came forward left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to God 
After almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land 
We tried to settle this dispute he said but could never come to an agreement 
I settled it tonight he continued 
I leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart I have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor 
Forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the Kingdom of God 
You cannot wear the banner of God and at the same time harbor envy jealousy and grudges in your heart 
Henry Van Dyke said forgive and forget if you can  but forgive anyway 
Jesus made three things clear about forgiveness 
We must first of all be willing to forgive others before we can secure God's forgiveness 
For if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you  but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive  your trespasses 
Matthew 6  14 15 
It will do no good to seek God's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong 
Then Jesus indicated that God's forgiveness is unlimited 
In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words forgive us our debts 
When a person meets God's requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven 
God's mercy and patience will last forever 
Forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by God's love 
It also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past 
We want the past forgiven but at the same time we must be willing for God to direct the future 
Finally we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us 
Once Peter asked how oft shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him 
Till seven times 
Jesus saith unto him until seventy times seven 
Matthew 18  21 22 
Jesus not only taught forgiveness He gave us an example of it on the cross 
With all the energy of his broken body he prayed Father forgive them for they know not what they do 
Luke 34 
She's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now although she's still a teen ager who looks like a baby she is getting married 
Her mother now dead was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring I had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her something her mother would wish said 
For a while there was such shrill girlish commotion I couldn't have made myself heard if I'd had the equivalent of the message to Garcia 
But when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female  six girls sprawled on one bed drinking Cokes and giggling  she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute 
How do you know you love somebody enough to get married 
She asked 
It was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked  how can you be sure 
Aren't you sure 
I asked looking at her searchingly 
I wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait to consider to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important 
But if she were just having a normal case of pre nuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage 
Besides in all honesty I don't know how you can be sure 
I don't know any secret recipe for certainty 
In the fevered intoxicating breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured 
I knew of but one test and I threw it out to her for what it was worth 
Does he ever bore you 
I asked 
Bore me 
She was shocked 
Oh no o ] why he's so darling and I mean I went on ruthlessly when he's not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love is he interesting 
Does he care about things that matter to you 
Can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating 
Because honey I thought silently there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage  long periods when you're hopelessly stranded together 
And if you bore each other then heaven help you 
She came back the other day to reassure me 
She has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting 
She asked if I had other advice and heady with success I rushed it in I hope not too late 
Be friends with your mother in law 
Jokes cartoons and cynics to the contrary mothers in law make good friends 
I do not know Dr Wilson Sneed well 
But I was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of St Luke's Church in Atlanta 
It was the cry of not just one heart  it spoke for many in the clergy I suspect 
The pulpit is a lonely place 
Who stops to think of that 
Imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church 
Such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments he told his members 
A minister should not stay beyond the time that his leadership should benefit his church he wrote for he becomes ordinary 
And so the young minister resigned to go and study and pray having never passed a day he told his parishioners when I did not gain from you far more than I ever gave to you 
His very honest act called up the recent talk I had with another minister a modest Methodist who said  I feel so deeply blessed by God when I can give a message of love and comfort to other men and I would have it no other way  and it is unworthy to think of self 
But oh how I do sometimes need just a moment of rest and peace in myself 
A man who gives himself to God and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving 
He does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach 
The good ones are not motivated to seek vainly nor are they disposed to covet comfort or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity 
Theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards 
Yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him  we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul 
We press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word and God's 
We do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty but we add to their burden while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week American cash 
If we break the minister to our bit we are buying back our own sins 
If he won't break we add to the stress he bears 
And a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man  prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to 
We expect him to be noble and to make us so  yet he knows and tries to tell us how very humble man must be 
We expect bestowal of God's love through him 
But how little love we give him 
The church truly is not a rest home for saints but a hospital for sinners 
Yet every Sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers too 
Mr Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at Loon Lake 
The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure 
The evening was not always spent in the same way 
This year on a night cool with the front of September moving in but with plenty of summer still about the Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod 
The little cottage was bursting with people of all ages 
In the midst of it all Mr Podger came out on the Pod porch alone 
He had that day attended a country auction and he had come back with a prize 
The prize was an old fashioned woven cloth hammock complete with cross top pillow fringed side pieces and hooks for hanging 
Mrs Podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it and there it was slung in a vine shaded corner the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow caressing movement 
Mr Podger sat down in it pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow rhythmic motions and then swung his feet up into it 
He closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him 
Suddenly one young voice rose above the others 
But it said do you always know when you're happy 
The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound but the question stayed in Mr Podger's mind 
Here in the cool autumn touched evening Mr Podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace 
It had begun with the blue jay feather 
Walking along the lake before breakfast Mr Podger had seen the feather and the bird that had lost it in flight 
The winging spread of blue had gone on calling harshly into the wood 
The small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet 
All day long Mr Podger who was a straw hat man in the summer had worn the feather in the band of his broad brimmed sunshield 
Would a blue feather in a man's hat make him happy all day 
Hardly 
But it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake 
Then since the auction was being held nearby he had walked to it 
And there on the way had been the box turtle that slow self contained world ignoring relic of pre history bent for reasons best known to itself on crossing the road 
It was doing very well too having reached the center and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when Mr Podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car 
Would the driver see the turtle 
Would he take pains to avoid it 
Mr Podger took no chances 
Taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it Mr Podger stepped into the road lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road crossing with what must have been a breath taking suddenness 
The turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon 
But Mr Podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other 
Here in the cool darkness Mr Podger could still feel the warmth of midday could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road could still see the friendly grin on the young sun browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight 
Where was the driver now 
What was he doing 
And the turtle 
Mr Podger smiled 
For a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama 
The three would never meet again but for some reason or other Mr Podger was sure he would always remember the incident 
Then there had been the auction itself 
Mr Podger heard again  at will the voice of the auctioneer the voices of the bidders and finally the small boy who had been so interested in Mr Podger's hammock purchase 
I like them things too he had said 
We got one at home 
You know what 
If you're lyin' out in the hammock at night and it gets kinda cool  you know  you just take these sides with the fringe on  see  and wrap 'em right over you 
I do it lots o' times  I like to lie in a hammock at night by myself when it's all quiet 
The wind moves it a little bit  you know 
Mr Podger had thanked him gravely and now he made use of the advice 
As he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon Mr Podger saw that thin attractive freckled little face again and hoped that the boy too was lying in a cool fringed wrapped quiet 
Alacrity the Podger cat came by the hammock rubbed her back briefly against it and then sure of a welcome hopped up 
She remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly and Mr Podger took her inside the fringe 
Soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets rivaled the hum of voices from inside the Pod 
Mr Podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and Pam burst out 
Dad ] she said 
It's getting so chilly we've lighted a fire and we're going to tell a round robin story  a nice scary one 
We need you to start it 
Why are you out here all by yourself 
Aren't you happy 
Mr Podger opened his cocoon and emerged tucking Alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire 
Of course I am he said 
Never happier in my life 
I just came out here to know it 
Dallas as the South begins another school year national and even world attention is directed at the region's slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools 
Desegregation is beginning in two more important Southern cities  Dallas and Atlanta 
In each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment 
These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully 
The programs do not take sides on the issue itself 
They point out simply that it is the law of the land 
The two cities have the examples of Little Rock and New Orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation 
Even better they have the examples of Nashville and Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs 
In each case there was an initial act of violence 
In Nashville a school was dynamited 
In Houston there were a few incidents of friction between whites and Negroes none of which were serious 
In each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents 
The Nashville plan incidentally has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled South 
It is a stair step plan in which desegregation begins in the first grade 
Each year another grade is added to the process until finally all 12 grades are integrated 
The schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done so why not now 
The program has worked well in both Nashville and Houston 
It met a serious rebuff in New Orleans where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents 
Another attempt will be made this year in New Orleans to resume the program 
Generally throughout the South there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met 
Perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in Dallas 
During the summer Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments 
It was part of a citywide move toward full integration 
So successful has been this program worked out by white and Negro civic leaders that further extensions are expected in the next few months 
Hotels for example are ready to let down the bars 
Already at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis 
Several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis 
This is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago when a series of bombings was directed against Negroes who were moving into previously all white neighborhoods of Dallas 
It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the South 
Southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop Negroes from claiming equal rights 
They insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots 
All across the South there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it 
There are many causes for this change 
One of the most important is economic 
Business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence 
They are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order 
In the past these same Southerners were inclined to look the other way 
And as the businessmen have begun to act a real sense of co operation has sprung up 
This co operation has emboldened other Southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation 
They realize that by acting in concert rather than individually they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation  economic and otherwise 
Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California a few months ago I've been introduced to a new game called Lanesmanship 
Played mostly on the freeways around Los Angeles it goes like this  a driver cruising easily at 70 m p h in Lane *j of a four lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead 
Traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into Lane *j which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m p h 
The adjacent driver in Lane *j has three choices open to him 
He can  1  point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into Lane *j   2  slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes  or  3  alternately accelerate and decelerate thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair 
The really remarkable thing to me is that most California natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access 
Whether or not this is done out of enlightened self preservation I don't know 
But it is done consistently and I'm both surprised and impressed 
This could never happen in my native Chicago 
There such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood 
In Chicago the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back 
Failing this he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly 
This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways however does an injustice to Southern California drivers 
At the risk of losing my charge a plate at Marshall Field and Company I would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype 
After three months of research I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers I've ever encountered 
During one recent day of driving about Los Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street 
Miami Fla  March 17 
An out of town writer came up to Paul Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year 
Now Richards of course is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go 
He can often make the complex ridiculously simple and vice versa 
This happened to be vice versa but even so the answer was a masterpiece 
It's a whole lot easier he said to increase the population of Nevada than it is to increase the population of New York city 
And with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher 
That is undoubtedly a hell of a quote said the writer scratching his head 
Now if I can just figure out what he's talking about I'll use it 
Two spots open this was just Richard's way of saying that last year the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open 
Some brilliant rookies nailed them down so that this spring just two spots left and right field are really up for grabs 
It should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year but so far it hasn't worked that way 
This angle of just where the Orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one 
You'd never guess it from the way they've played so far this spring but there remains a feeling among some around here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961 
Obviously if this club is going to move from second to first in the American League it will have to show improvement someplace 
Where can that improvement possibly come from 
You certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than it did last year 
Robby could be better 
Brooks Robinson is great and it is conceivable that he'll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960 
You can't expect it though 
Robby's performance last year was tremendous 
It's the same with Ron Hansen and Jim Gentile 
If they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint 
They shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden 
Hansen will be getting a late spring training start which might very well set him back 
He got off to an exceptional start last season and under the circumstances probably won't duplicate it 
There are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year 
They don't expect to stop him just slow him down some with the bat 
He'll still be a top player they concede because he's got a great glove and the long ball going for him 
But they expect to reduce his over all offensive production 
Breeding might move up 
Gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs 
Don't ask him more 
I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move up a notch 
But even so he had a good year in 1960 and won't do too much better 
So all in all the infield can't be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from second to first 
And the pitching will also have trouble doing better 
Richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season 
Where then can we look for improvement 
From Triandos Brandt and Walker answers Richards 
They're the ones we can expect to do better 
The man is right and at this time indications are that these three are ready for better seasons 
Triandos hasn't proved it yet but he says he's convinced his thumb is all right 
He jammed it this spring and has had to rest it but he says the old injury hasn't bothered him 
If he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years the club will have to be better off offensively 
I'm still not convinced though I'll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him 
Hank Foiles backed up by Frank House who will be within calling distance in the minors make up better second line catching than the Birds had all last year but Gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant 
To me Brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year 
He hasn't played too much because Richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice 
He's hitting the ball hard in the batting cage and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year 
When he came to Baltimore he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the National League pennant and he was joining what seemed to be a second division American League club 
He was down hard to talk to and far too nonchalant on the field 
As of now that all seems behind him 
He's been entirely different all spring 
And Walker looks stronger seems to be throwing better than he did last year 
Let him bounce back and he could really set up the staff 
So if the Orioles are to improve Brandt Triandos and Walker will have to do it 
So far the platoons on left and right fielders don't seem capable of carrying the load 
Of course this isn't taking into consideration the population of Nevada and New York city but it's the way things look from here at this point 
Is the mother of an autistic child at fault 
 the autistic child is one who seems to lack a well defined sense of self 
He tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects  and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people 
 did his mother make him this way 
Some people believe she did 
We think differently 
We believe that autism like so many other conditions of defect and deviation is to a large extent inborn 
A mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties 
Sometimes she can  to a large extent  help him overcome them 
But we don't think she creates them 
We don't think she can make her child defective emotionally disturbed or autistic 
The mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often by sharing her experiences she can help other mothers with the same problem 
Since little is known about autism and almost nothing has been written for the layman we'd like to share one experienced mother's comments 
She wrote  total disinterest 
As the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything I have to manipulate my son's fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy 
He wants me to do everything for him 
You don't believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them 
But I do and my psychiatrist does too 
I know that my son wants control and direction but being autistic myself I cannot give full control or direction 
One thing I notice which I have seldom heard mentioned 
This is that autistic people don't enjoy physical contact with others  for instance my children and I 
When I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board 
He pushes and straightens himself as if he can't stand the feeling of being held 
Physical contact is uncomfortable for him ] this mother is quite correct 
As a rule the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others 
Parents have to find other ways of comforting him 
For the young child this may be no more than providing food light or movement 
As he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object  his magic thing  
Or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick 
The answer is different for each autistic child but for most there is an answer 
Only ingenuity will uncover it 
What future holds dear Doctors  we learned this year that our older son Daniel is autistic 
We did not accept the diagnosis at once but gradually we are coming to 
Fortunately there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend with a group of normal children 
I try to treat Daniel as if he were normal though of course I realize he is far from that at present 
What I do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible 
I try to give him as many normal experiences as possible 
What is your experience with autistic children 
How do they turn out later 
Many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives 
Certainly most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people but many adjust to school even college to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood 
Single color use question  a first grader colors pictures one solid color everything  sky grass boy wagon etc 
When different colors are used she is just as likely to color trees purple hair green etc 
The other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color 
Should I show my daughter how things should be colored 
She is an aggressive nervous child 
Is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits 
Answer  her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects 
This immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade 
No coloring isn't exactly something you teach a child 
You sometimes give them a little demonstration a little guidance and suggestions about staying inside the lines 
But most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration 
Seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art  embroidery 
Possibly responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms which seems slated to replace the one color look to which we have been accustomed 
Just as a varitinted Oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme so may some of the newest versions of embroidery 
One such in fact is a rug 
Though not actually crewel embroidery it has that look with its over stitched raised pattern in blue pink bronze and gold and a sauterne background 
The twirled stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the Jacobean period in England 
Traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country 
The work is executed in England  by hand  and can be worked in any desired design and color 
Among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color 
Chinese influence for a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection of fine English Chippendale furniture fabric wall panels were embroidered with a typically Chinese inspired design of this revered Eighteenth Century period 
Since the work is done by hand the only limitation it is said is that of human conception 
Modern embroidered panels framed and meant to be hung on the wall are another aspect of this trend 
These have never gone out of style in Scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and there in shops which specialize in handicrafts 
An amateur decorator might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings and by picking up her living room color scheme add a decorative do it yourself note to the room 
California Democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district headquarters party clubrooms and workers' backyards 
They seem darned proud of it 
And they're confident that the *j currently assailed by dissensions within the ranks will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots fueled machine 
Their meeting at San Francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the California Democratic Council directorate 
But it will include 200 odd officeholders organization leaders and interested party people 
Out of this session may come  1  plans for a dramatic broad scale party rally in Los Angeles next December that would enlist top drawer Democrats from all over the country 
2  blueprints for doubling the *j present 55 000 enrollment 
3  arrangements for a statewide pre primary endorsing convention in Fresno next Jan 26 28 
4  and proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate picking conventions in the state's 38 new Congressional districts 
At the head of the *j is an unorthodox 39 year old amateur politico Thomas B Carvey Jr  whose normal profession is helping develop Hughes Aircraft's moon missiles 
He's approached his Democratic duties in hard nosed engineering fashion 
Viewed from afar the *j looks like a rather stalwart political pyramid  its elected directorate fans out into an array of district leaders and standing committees and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups  500 or so 
Much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every volunteer Democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the *j 
Moreover the entire state Democratic hierarchy from Gov Brown on down to the county chairmen also participates in this huge operation 
Contrarily Republican volunteers go their separate ways and thus far have given no indication that they'd be willing to join forces under a single directorate except in the most loose knit fashion 
Carvey believes that reapportionment which left many Democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries actually will increase *j membership 
Where only one club existed before he says two will flourish henceforth 
Biggest organizational problem he adds is setting up *j units in rock ribbed Democratic territory 
Paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register 4 and 5 to 1 in the party's favor strongest where Democrats and Republicans compete on a fairly even basis 
Like most Democratic spokesmen Carvey predicts 1962 will be a tremendously partisan year 
Hence the attention they're lavishing on the *j 
In all probability the council will screen and endorse candidates for the Assembly and for Congress and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre primary favorites 
This bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been staked out by Democratic hopefuls who don't see eye to eye with the *j 
Naturally the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council 
Shunted aside by the rampant organizers for John F Kennedy last year who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the Presidential campaign the *j plainly intends to provide the party's campaign muscle in 1962 
There is evidence that it will be happily received by Gov Brown and the other constitutional incumbents 
Carvey considers that former Vice President Nixon would be Brown's most formidable foe with ex *gov Knight a close second 
But the rest of the *j gubernatorial aspirants don't worry him very much 
In his *j work Carvey has the close in support and advice of one of California's shrewdest political strategists  former Democratic National Committeeman Paul Ziffren who backed him over a Northland candidate espoused by Atty Gen Stanley Mosk 
 significantly bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that saw Mosk moving into the national committee post over Ziffren are still audible in party circles 
 note  we've just received an announcement of the 54th Assembly district post reapportionment organizing convention Wednesday night in South Pasadena's War Memorial Bldg  which graphically illustrates the *j broad appeal 
State Sen Dick Richards will keynote  state and county committeemen *j directors and representatives members of 16 area clubs and all residents have been invited 
This is going to be a language lesson and you can master it in a few minutes 
It is a short course in Communese 
It works with English Russian German Hungarian or almost any other foreign tongue 
Once you learn how to translate Communese much of each day's deluge of news will become clearer 
At least I have found it so 
For some compulsive reason which would have fascinated Dr Freud Communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves 
They accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most guilty 
President Kennedy's latest warning to the Communist world that the United States will build up its military strength to meet any challenge in Berlin or elsewhere was somewhat surprisingly reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the Iron Curtain 
Then the Communese reply came back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency 
Now listen closely  Moscow radio from the Literary Gazette in English to England  President Kennedy once again interpreted the Soviet proposals to sign a peace treaty with Germany as a threat as part of the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism 
Evidently the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred up in the West have been planned long in advance 
The West Berlin crisis is being played up artificially because it is needed by the United States to justify its arms drive 
The Soviet news agency *j datelined from New York in English to Europe  President Kennedy's enlargement of the American military program was welcomed on Wall Street as a stimulus to the American munitions industry 
When the stock exchange opened this morning many dealers were quick to purchase shares in Douglas Lockheed and United Aircraft and prices rose substantially 
Over 4 million shares were sold the highest figures since early June 
 quotations follow 
 *j datelined Los Angeles in English to Europe  former Vice President Nixon came out in support of President Kennedy's program for stepping up the arms race 
He also demanded that Kennedy take additional measures to increase international tension  specifically to crush the Cuban revolution resume nuclear testing resist more vigorously admission of China to its lawful seat in the United Nations and postpone non military programs at home 
T*a*s*s from Moscow in English to Europe  the American press clamored for many days promising President Kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems confronting the United States 
In fact the world heard nothing but sabre rattling the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors of the current President 
If there were no West Berlin problem imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems besetting the United States and its *j partners 
Washington apparently decided to use an old formula by injecting large military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the U *s economy after a prolonged slump 
And now for Communist listeners and readers  Moscow Radio in Russian to the *j  the U *s President has shown once again that the United States needs the fanning of the West Berlin crisis to justify the armaments race 
As was to be expected Kennedy's latest speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge seeking circles in Bonn where officials of the West German government praised it 
Moscow Novosti article in Russian datelined London  U *s pressure on Britain to foster war hysteria over the status of West Berlin has reached its apogee 
British common sense is proverbial 
The present attempts of the politicians to contaminate ordinary Britons shows that this British common sense is unwilling to pull somebody else's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures 
East Berlin  Communist  radio in German to Germany  a better position for negotiations is the real point of this speech 
Kennedy knows the West will not wage war for West Berlin neither conventional nor nuclear and negotiations will come as certainly as the peace treaty 
Whenever some Washington circles were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the Pentagon and in Bonn 
In Kennedy's speech are cross currents sensible ones and senseless ones reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the President's advisers and the political and economic forces behind them 
Well dear listeners despite all the shouting there will be no war over West Berlin 
Moscow *j in Russian datelined Sochi  Chairman Khrushchev received the U *s President's disarmament adviser John Mc*cloy 
Their conversation and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere 
Now to translate from the Communese this means  the West Berlin crisis is really an East Berlin crisis 
The crisis was artificially stirred up by the Kremlin  Wall Street  and the Red Army  Pentagon  egged on by the West Germans  East Germans  
The reason was to speed up domestic production in the *j which Khrushchev promised upon grabbing power and try to end the permanent recession in Russian living standards 
Chairman Khrushchev  Kennedy  rattles his rockets  sabre  in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position 
His advisers in the Politburo  White House  are engaged in a great struggle of opinions so he is not always consistent 
The Soviet Union will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over Berlin and neither will its Warsaw Pact allies 
The West has no intention of attacking Russia 
Chairman Khrushchev and John Mc*cloy had a terrible row at Sochi 
See Communese is easy  once you get onto it 
Aug 4 1821 nearly a century after Benjamin Franklin founded the Pennsylvania Gazette  a century during which it had undergone several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication  this paper made its first appearance as the Saturday Evening Post 
The country was now full of Gazettes and Samuel C Atkinson and Charles Alexander who had just taken over Franklin's old paper desired a more distinctive name 
When founded by Franklin the Gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually contained more and more fiction poetry and literary essays 
In the middle of the century with a circulation of 90 000 the Post was one of the most popular weeklies in the country 
But during the second half of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 Cyrus H K Curtis purchased it  paper type and all  for $1 000 it was a 16 page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and initialed miscellany and with only some 2 000 subscribers 
Little more than a fine old name valuable principally because of the Franklin tradition the Saturday Evening Post was slow to revive 
But Curtis poured over $1 million into it and in time it again became one of the most popular weeklies of the country

The 350th anniversary of the King James Bible is being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the New Testament the first part of the New English Bible undertaken as a new translation of the Scriptures into contemporary English 
Since it was issued in the spring of 1611 the King James Version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the Bible 
However Biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced 
This resulted in revisions of the King James Bible in 1881 85 as the English Revised Version and in 1901 as the American Standard Version 
Then in 1937 America's International Council of Religious Education authorized a new revision in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages 
Undertaken by 32 American scholars under the chairmanship of Rev Dr Luther A Weigle former dean of Yale University Divinity School their studies resulted in the publishing of the Revised Standard Version 1946 52 
Not rival the New English Bible  the Old Testament and Apocrypha will be published at a future date  has not been planned to rival or replace the King James Version but as its cover states it is offered simply as the Bible to all those who will use it in reading teaching or worship 
Time of course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose 
Bible reading even more so than good classical music grows in depth and meaning upon repetition 
If this new Bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years it will not survive the ages as has the King James Version 
However an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the British Biblical scholars 
One is impressed with the dignity clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary English and there is no doubt that the meaning of the Bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the King James 
For example in the third chapter of Matthew verses 13 16 describing the baptism of Jesus the 1611 version reads  then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him 
But John forbad him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me 
And Jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now  for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness 
Then he suffered him 
And Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water  and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him 
Clearer meaning certainly the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with Biblical teachings in the New English Bible which reads  then Jesus arrived at Jordan from Galilee and he came to John to be baptized by him 
John tried to dissuade him 
Do you come to me 
He said  I need rather to be baptized by you 
Jesus replied let it be so for the present  we do well to conform this way with all that God requires 
John then allowed him to come 
After baptism Jesus came up out of the water at once and at that moment heaven opened  he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove to alight upon him   the paragraphing spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version 
 among the most frequently quoted Biblical sentences are the Beatitudes and yet so few persons other than scholars really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by Jesus at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount 
To illustrate the first blessing in the King James Bible reads  blessed are the poor in spirit  for their's is the kingdom of heaven 
The new version states  how blest are those who know that they are poor  the kingdom of Heaven is theirs 
Some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one but almost anyone with a fair knowledge of the English language can understand the meaning without the necessity of interpretation by a Biblical scholar 
To a novice that is significant 
In the second and third chapters of Revelation the new version retains however the old phrase angel of the church which Biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop 
This is not contemporary English 
Mostly contemporary for the most part however the new version is contemporary and as such should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of Christ 
Originally recorded by hand these words have been copied and recopied translated and retranslated through the ages 
Discoveries recently made of old Biblical manuscripts in Hebrew and Greek and other ancient writings some by the early church fathers in themselves called for a restudy of the Bible 
To have the results recorded in everyday usable English should be of benefit to all who seek the truth 
There is one danger however 
With contemporary English changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic 
The only answer will be continuous study

Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet 
That is why it is important to invest in comfortable airy types of shoes 
There are many soft and light shoe leathers available 
Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers 
Softness is found in crushed textures 
Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape 
Heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette 
Wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi heights 
Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes 
Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps 
Coolest shade while white is the coolest summer shade there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color 
In the tintable group are high and little heels squared and oval throats and shantung like textures 
Don't overlook the straws this year 
They come in crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues along with lacey open weaves with a lustre finish in natural white black and a whole range of colors 
In the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles 
For added comfort some of the Italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning 
The citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot 
Orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac 
In a brighter nautical vein is Ille De France blue 
Contrast trim provides other touches of color

An electric toothbrush  Broxodent  may soon take its place next to the electric razor in the American bathroom 
The brush moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface including the back of the teeth 
In addition the motor has the seal of approval of the Underwriters Laboratories which means it is safe 
The unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged in 
The speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor 
The brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own 
Most of us brush our teeth by hand 
The same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men 
The electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction the way dentists recommend 
In addition it is small enough to get into crevices jacket and crown margins malposed anteriors and the back teeth 
The bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel 
It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly 
Several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device 
The results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly 
The electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly bedfast with a chronic disease or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy 
But for many of us it will prove an enjoyable luxury 
It is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy off the bristles 
Since the apparatus is new it requires experimentation and changes in technique

There's more specialization and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by Dover Publications 
Dover publishes what the company calls Listen And Learn Productions designed to teach foreign languages 
Previous presentations have been on French Spanish Russian Italian German and Japanese 
But the firm has recognized the tight dollar and the tourist's desire to visit the smaller less traveled and relatively inexpensive countries and is now prepared to teach modern Greek and Portuguese through recordings 
The respective vocabularies essential for travel are available in separate albums 
Thanks to Spoken Arts Records history buffs may hear Lincoln's most memorable speeches and letters in a two disc set interpreted by Lincoln authority and lecturer Roy P Basler

Teaching guides are included with each record 
In an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen upsets sure to arise in the future Herbert A Leggett banker editor of the Phoenix Arizona Progress reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties 
One of the roughest was the *j quiz shows which gave him inferiority complexes 
Though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent well informed American 
But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $2 000 000 profit on the stock market 
Every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb 
Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough 
People who take us for suckers are like the Westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull's eye achievements 
The promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it 
His answer was simple but honest 
He just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bull's eye 
One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2 year old child is a lack of verbal communication 
The child understands no 
He senses his mother's disapproval 
But explanations leave him confused and unmoved 
If his mother loves him he clings to that love as a ballast 
It motivates his behavior 
He wants Mommy to think him a good boy 
He doesn't want her to look frowningly at him or speak to him angrily 
This breaks his heart 
He wants to be called sweet good considerate and mother's little helper 
But even mother's loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior 
His desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother's love for him and what she expects of him in order to overcome them 
His own inner voice which should tell him what not to do has not developed 
It won't develop until he has words with which to clothe it 
The conscience is non existent in the 2 year old 
What can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior 
She can decrease the number of temptations 
She can remove all knick knacks within reach 
The fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be 
She should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child 
If he can't play with Mommy's magazines he should have some old numbers of his own 
If Daddy's books are out of bounds his own picture books are not 
Toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove 
During this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child's conscience 
She tells him of the consequences of his behavior 
If he bites a playmate she says Danny won't like you 
If he snatches a toy she says Caroline wants her own truck just as you do 
There is no use trying to Explain to a 2 year old 
Actions speak louder 
Remove temptations 
Remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior 
Substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act 
He won't submit to his natural desires all the time and it's Mother's love that is responsible for his good behavior 
This is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call Homecoming Day 
They seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes 
The football opponent on homecoming is of course selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a Christian when thrown to one of the emperor's lions 
It is true of course the uncertainties of life being what they are that as now and then the Christian killed the lion homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team 
Even with all possible precaution homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them 
More often than not as the Old Grad wanders along the old paths his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain 
He can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter and can smell again the aroma of autumn  fallen leaves the wine of cool air and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall 
Undergraduates it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates faces alight holding hands and talking happily as they come along oblivious of him or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances such as they would give a tethered goat 
Usually they titter loudly after they have passed by 
His dream goes 
He feels suddenly the weight of the fat that is on him 
His bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous 
His bifocals blur 
His legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary as if he had walked for miles instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the old campus paths 
Bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth 
It is not much better if he meets with old classmates 
Too often unless he hails them they pass him by 
He recalls with a wry smile the wit who said on returning from a homecoming reunion that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didn't even recognize him 
If they do meet and recognize one another slap backs and embrace the moment soon is done 
After all when one has asked whatever became of old Joe and Charlie when one has inquired who it was Sue Brown married and where it is they now live when questions are asked and answered about families and children and old professors when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted that does it 
Middle aged spread by then one begins to notice the middle age spread  the gray hairs the eyeglasses bodies that are too thin or too heavy  the fading signs of old beauty  the athlete of by gone years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length then it is time to break it up and move on 
It is if anything worse on the old player he sits in the stands and he doesn't like that 
Enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd 
He always feels lonely 
A team feels something 
On a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him 
In the stands he is lonely and lost no matter how many are about him 
He sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped  the churning of straining feet the rasp of the canvas pants  the smell and feel of hot wet woolen sleeves across his face 
He remembers the desperate panting breath  the long runs on the kick offs  the hard jolting tackles  the breakthrough  the desperate agony of goal line stands 
And so he squirms with each play remembering his youth 
But it is no use 
It is gone 
No matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength they can never be recaptured again 
Since the obvious is not always true the Republican National Committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred as suspected in the larger cities 
Of 40 cities with populations of 300 000 and more Mr Kennedy carried 26 and Mr Nixon 14 
There are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election 
These are New York Pennsylvania Michigan Maryland Missouri New Jersey Illinois and Minnesota 
In 1952 Mr Eisenhower won all but Missouri 
Yet in 1960 all eight gave majorities to Mr Kennedy 
Republican research broke down the vote in Philadelphia 
Mr Nixon despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups failed to do so 
His visit to Warsaw Poland after the Russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the Polish vote which in several cities is substantial 
Yet the *j breakdown discovered that in Philadelphia Mr Nixon received but 21 per cent of the so called Polish vote  30 per cent of the Irish vote and 18 per cent of the Negro vote 
Task force a *j task force committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities 
The task force might make a start in Washington with Republican congressional leaders 
These gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of Mr Kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment 
This error was compounded by declaring the recession to be a statistical one and not a reality 
The almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working part time do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical 
They did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by Secretary of Labor Goldberg as politics which the *j declared it to be 
The people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery 
Senator Mundt's gross distortion of President Eisenhower's conversation into a denunciation of President Kennedy as too left wing a statement Mr Eisenhower declared to be entirely false is another case in point 
If the Republicans and Southern Democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the Social Security program they will thereby erect still another barrier to *j hopes in the cities 
Errors repeated the present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt Goldwater Bridges Dirksen et al is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s 
In that decade the partisan zeal to defend Mr Hoover and the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the depression caused a great majority of Americans to see the Republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash 
The Republican party was not lacking in humanity but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble 
Farmers called their mule drawn pickup trucks Hoover carts 
Smokers reduced to the makings spoke of the sack tobacco as Hoover dust 
One may be sure the present Republican congressional leadership hasn't meant to repeat this error 
But it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade John F Kennedy 
That this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like the way in which the new President is conducting the nation's business 
The most articulate Republicans are those who in their desire to get back at Mr Kennedy already have created the image of a Republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care 
If they also defeat the school bill the *j task force won't have much research to do 
It will early know why the party won't win back city votes 
The 1962 General Assembly has important business to consider 
The tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner 
After the Griffin *byrd political troup has completed the circuit in November in the name of a Pre *legislative Forum this is going to be the most politically oriented Legislature in history 
Every legislator from Brasstown Bald to Folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances not his convictions 
Hoped for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever 
And just how far can the Legislature go toward setting up a self insurance system for the state in the midst of a governor's race 
How unpartisan will be the recommendations of Lt Gov Garland Byrd's Senate Committee on Government Operations 
The situation already was bad because the Legislature moved the governor's race forward a few months causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual 
But when former Gov Marvin Griffin and Lt Gov Byrd accepted the invitations of the Georgia State Chamber of Commerce to join the tour next November the situation was aggravated 
Neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation 
To have refused would have been political suicide 
And it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity when the bravado comments are cast aside 
The Georgia State Chamber of Commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates 
It wanted the State Democratic Executive Committee to pick the serious candidates 
But State Party Chairman James Gray of Albany said no and he didn't mince any words 
They are just asking too much he said 
We can't think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates either 
There are other dangers  politics is an accelerating game 
If an opponent accuses you of lying don't deny it 
Say he is a horse thief runs an old adage 
These men are spenders 
If either one ever started making promises there is no telling where the promises would end 
Griffin's Rural Roads Authority and Byrd's 60 000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper's oaths 
The trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one 
Why not have them travel the state in November debating 
It would present a forum for them in almost every community 
But further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor's race being run in the next Legislature the spectre of big spending programs the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin 
There is a way out of this 
The Chamber has not arranged a pre legislative forum 
It has arranged a campaign for governor 
If it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed next spring and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates it can provide a service to the state 
But the Legislature should be granted the opportunity to complete its work before choosing up sides for the race 
Former British Prime Minister Attlee says Eisenhower was not a great soldier 
Ike's somewhat like George Washington 
Both won a pretty fair sized war with a modest assist from British strategy 
Congressmen returning from recess say the people admire President Kennedy so much they're even willing to heed his call to sacrifice  and give up his program 
Slogan of the John Birch Society  paddle your own canoe 
The guy who makes the motor boats may be a Communist 
A Republican survey says Kennedy won the '60 election on the religious issue 
Too many people were afraid if the *j won they'd have to spend all their time praying 
The Providence Journal editorial  Jan 25  entitled East Greenwich Faces A Housing Development Problem points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours 
Your suggested solution it seems to me is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward and endorsement of sound planning 
First of all there is ample area in East Greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested 
This land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town 
The demand for these lots can be met for some time to come 
This would seem to indicate that we are trying neither to halt an influx of migrants nor are we setting up such standards for development that only the well to do could afford to buy land and build in the new sites 
What we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development 
It is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs 
Bostitch Inc is approximately half way through a 10 year exemption of their real estate tax 
The wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter but this particular instance is in my opinion completely satisfactory 
The 1960 tax book for East Greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars 
With our current $3 per hundred tax rate it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should try to develop a modest industrial plant as the best way to meet these problems 
In order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure 
As this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow 
Mr Richard Preston executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission in his remarks to the Governors Conference on Industrial Development at Providence on October 8 1960 warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said  if this is the fundamental reason for a community's interest or if this is the basic approach success if any will be difficult to obtain 
He went on to say  in the first place industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities 
It is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be 
While Councilman Olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth 
We in East Greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools and the other facing this prospect next year 
It has already been reported in your newspapers that the East Greenwich School Committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase 
If they are to be commended for foresight in their planning what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage 
Where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other editorials 
I submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life 
The fruitful course of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of East Greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called 
For example  1 
The East Greenwich Police Department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the Warwick Police Department thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the Cowessett *east Greenwich *potowomut area of the two communities 
2 
The East Greenwich Fire District services parts of Warwick as well as East Greenwich 
3 
The taxpayers of East Greenwich appropriate sums of money as do other Kent County communities for the support of the Kent County Memorial Hospital a regional facility 
4 
The East Greenwich Free Library receives financial support from the town of East Greenwich and the City of Warwick to supplement its endowment 
5 
Feelers were put out last year to the City of Warwick as reported in your newspapers suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the Potowomut and Cowessett areas of Warwick along with East Greenwich 
6 
East Greenwich was one of the first Rhode Island towns to enter into contract agreement with the Rhode Island Development Council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves 
7 
The education program for retarded children conducted by the East Greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community 
I feel compelled to write this because I am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as East Greenwich 
I believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts  and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised 
These programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when where and in what manner the community shall grow 
We have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions 
Until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts I hope we in East Greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny 
I would like very much on behalf of my husband and myself to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the Gabrielle Fund 
It is indeed true as stated in the famous novel of our day For Whom The Bell Tolls that no man is an island entirely of itself  every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main 
Thanks to the generosity of Mr Irving J Fain president of the Temple Beth El  Rev De*witt Clemens pastor of the Mathewson Street Methodist Church  Mr Felix Miranda of the Imperial Knife Co  and to Mrs Rozella Switzer regional director of The National Conference of Christians and Jews who asked them to serve as a committee for the fund 
It is through them that we have become aware of the divine humanity in man and therefore that most people are noble helpful and good 
Bless you my friends for it is through love and service that brotherhood becomes a reality 
I am a sophomore at Mount Pleasant High School 
My future plans are to become a language teacher 
Of course having this desire I am very interested in education 
A few weeks ago I read in the Bulletin that there were to be given Chinese classes in Cranston 
The article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or over and must not be going to high school to attend these classes 
The following week I read in the Sunday paper that the students of Russia begin European and Asian languages in the seventh grade 
I wish you could see the situation as I see it 
If Russian pupils have to take these languages how come American students have a choice whether or not to take a language but have to face so many exceptions 
I do not think that America is like Russia not in the least ] I am proud of my country the small city I live in my wonderful parents my friends and my school  but I am also a young able and willing girl who wants to study the Chinese language but is not old enough 
Then people wonder why Russian pupils are more advanced than American students 
Well there lies your answer 
At the height of the first snowstorm we had it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency 
However the East Providence Rescue Squad made its way through to my home in time of desperation 
Words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me 
The concern they felt for me was such as I shall never forget and for which I will always be grateful 
The rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather 
Had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did perhaps I would not be here to commend them at this time 
Many thanks for a job well done 
The Providence Sunday Journal article  Jan 29  asking whether American taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have non service connected disabilities sounds as though The Providence Journal is desperate for news 
Usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page 
On the question of admission to Veterans Administration hospitals of service connected and non service connected disabled veterans it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service 
It can manifest itself before discharge from service or it can come out years later 
There is one other point we should never lose sight of  many veterans who enter *j hospitals as non service cases later qualify as service connected 
No psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years 
The arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non service connected case seem to be coldly impractical and out of step with the wishes of the general public 
I believe in priority for service connected disabled veterans in admission to *j hospitals 
But I don't believe we should close the door on non service connected patients 
This matter is of great importance and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death or at least serious injuries for many veterans 
Some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long 
There's a reason for this length of stay 
First of all the admitting physician in the *j hospital gets the patient as a new patient 
He has no experience with this veteran's previous medical record 
If the doctor is conscientious he wants to study the patient 
As a result it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient 
Secondly the *j physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient 
So he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery 
The American public must be presented with the facts concerning *j hospitalization 
The public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a *j hospital the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other 
The responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a *j hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital 
An adequate system of *j hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals 
It seems that open season upon veterans' hospitalization is once more upon us 
The American Medical Association is once again grinding out its tear soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the Veterans Administration medical program to the American taxpayer 
Do they the A *m *a  offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world 
We veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at *j hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness 
Nevertheless we wonder at the stand of the A *m *a on the health problem confronting the aged 
They opposed the Forand bill which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction  yet they supported the Eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars  matched incidentally by a federal grant  to initiate 
A lousy job Chicago Aug 9  no doubt there have been moments during every Presidency when the man in the White House has had feelings of frustration exasperation exhaustion and even panic 
This we can sympathetically understand 
But no President ever before referred to his as a lousy job  as Walter Trohan recently quoted President Kennedy as doing in conversation with Sen Barry Goldwater  
During his aggressive campaign to win his present position Mr Kennedy was vitriolic about this country's prestige abroad 
What does he think a remark like this lousy one does to our prestige and morale 
If the President of the United States really feels he won himself a lousy job then heaven help us all 
Questions shelters Evansville Ind  Aug 5  Defense Secretary Robert S Mc*namara has asked Congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters costing about 200 million dollars 
Why should Congress even consider allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection 
Top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long time 
The scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter 
This sum spent for foreign economic aid the peace corps food for peace or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay off in world peace increased world trade and prosperity for every country on the globe 
Let us prepare for peace instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization 
Short shorts on the campus Chicago Aug 4  it seems college isn't what it should be 
I refer to the attire worn by the students 
Upon a visit to a local junior college last week I was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts and the young men wearing Bermuda shorts 
Is this what our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college in a few years 
Education should be uppermost in their minds but with this attire how can anyone think it is so 
It looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves 
High school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students 
Many high school students go past my house every day and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen 
No matter how hot the day they are dressed properly and not in shorts 
Masaryk award Chicago Aug 9  the granting of the Jan Masaryk award August 13 to Senator Paul Douglas is a bitter example of misleading minorities 
Douglas has consistently voted to aid the people who killed Masaryk and against principles Masaryk died to uphold 
Douglas has voted for aid to Communists and for the destruction of individual freedom  public housing foreign aid etc  
Subsidies from *j Oak Park Aug 8  in Today's Voice the *j is urged to reduce fares for senior citizens 
Rising costs have increased the difficulties of the elderly and I would be the last to say they should not receive consideration 
But why is it the special responsibility of the *j to help these people 
Why should *j regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should 
The welfare of citizens old and young is the responsibility of the community not only of that part of it that rides the *j 
C*t*a regulars already subsidize transportation for school children policemen and firemen 
Marketing meat Chicago Aug 9  in reply to a letter in Today's Voice urging the sale of meat after 6 p m  I wish to state the other side of the story 
I am the wife of the owner of a small independent meat market 
My husband's hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a m to 7 p m the early part of the week and as late as 8 or 9 on week ends 
Now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings  and Sundays too for this is coming 
There is a trend to packaging meat at a central source freezing it and shipping it to outlying stores where meat cutters will not be required 
If a customer wishes a special cut it will not be available 
We are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged whether we want it or not 
Most women in this age of freezers shop for the entire week on week ends when prices are lower 
Also many working wives have children or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them 
Independent market owners work six days a week  and my husband hasn't had a vacation in 14 years 
No we are not greedy 
But if we closed the store for a vacation we would lose our customers to the chain stores in the next block 
The meat cutters' union which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets 
What it is trying to do is to protect the little man too as well as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores with choice of cut being made by the consumer not the store 
The Legion Convention and Sidney Holzman Chicago Aug 9  I too congratulate the American Legion of which I am proud to have been a member for more than 40 years on the recent state convention 
I regret that Bertha Madeira  Today's Voice  obtained incorrect information 
Had I been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege the matter she raised would have been clarified 
The resolution under discussion at the convention was to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the American flag 
Judges under the jurisdiction of the Chicago board of election commissioners are instructed to do this 
The resolution further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag 
It was my desire to advise the membership of the Legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and without an amendment to the law we could not enforce this 
My discussion with reference to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors who make available their private premises and not by innuendo criticize them 
At no time did I attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the Chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties 
Teaching the handicapped Chicago Aug 7  the Illinois Commission for Handicapped Children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the Catholic charities of the archdiocese of Chicago and De*paul University of the establishment of the Institute for Special Education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally retarded children 
In these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field 
The Illinois Commission for Handicapped Children which for 20 years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children of studying the needs of handicapped children in Illinois and of promoting more adequate services for them indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of Illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children 
From Candlelight Club Minneapolis Aug 7  I just want to let you know how much I enjoyed your June 25 article on Liberace and to thank you for it 
Please do put more pictures and articles in about Liberace as he is truly one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person 
More school less pay Chicago Aug 7  is this perhaps one of the things that is wrong with our country 
Engineering graduates of Illinois Institute of Technology are reported receiving the highest average starting salaries in the school's history  $550 a month 
My son who has completed two years in engineering school has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled laborer 
At a rate of $3 22 an hour he is now earning approximately $580 a month 
Ironic is it not that after completing years of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer 
The Dupont case  editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page  
Washington Aug 4  your July 26 editorial regarding the position of Attorney General Robert F Kennedy on prospective tax relief for Du*pont stockholders is based on an erroneous statement of fact 
As a result your criticism of Attorney General Robert F Kennedy and the Department of Justice was inaccurate unwarranted and unfair 
The editorial concerned legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on Du*pont stockholders in connection with the United States Supreme Court ruling that Du*pont must divest itself of its extensive General Motors stock holdings 
These proposals would reduce the amount of tax that Du*pont stockholders might have to pay  from an estimated 1 1 billion dollars under present law to as little as 192 million dollars 
Congressman Wilbur D Mills chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee asked the Department of Justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they related to anti trust law enforcement 
The Attorney General responded by letter dated July 19 
Copies of this letter were made avaliable to the press and public 
In this letter Mr Kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration  what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti trust judgments 
There are a number of other considerations besides this one but it is for the Congress not the Department of Justice to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation 
Yet your editorial said  now the Attorney General writes that no considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion 
What Mr Kennedy in fact wrote was  it is the Department's view that no anti trust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion 
The editorial by omitting the words anti trust enforcement totally distorted Mr Kennedy's views 
The headline is offensive particularly in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial 
Congresswoman Church Wilmette Aug 7  I concur most heartily with today's letter on the futility of writing to Sen Dirksen and Sen Douglas 
But when you write to Congresswoman Church bless her heart your letter is answered fully and completely 
Should she disagree she explains why in detail 
When she agrees you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged 
I think we have the hardest working best representative in Congress 
Harmful drinks Downers Grove Aug 8  a recent news story reported that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin delayed 103 airplane passengers 10 minutes in London while they finished their drinks 
They do our country great harm by such actions 
Those in the public eye should be good examples of American citizens while abroad 
The plane should have started at the scheduled time and left Sinatra and Martin to guzzle 
Toward socialism Providence Aug 5  overt socialism means government ownership and management of a nation's main industries 
In covert socialism  toward which America is moving  private enterprise retains the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually controls them 
In order to attract new industries 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise 
This is a step toward overt socialism 
Issuing bonds for plant construction has brought new industries to certain regions 
Workers of the party to the editor  Sir  we are writing in reference to a recent suggestion made to the staff of the Public Health Nursing Service of Jersey City  registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences  
The day before Election Day to which we are entitled as a legal holiday we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as workers of the party 
Being ethical and professional people interested in community health and well being we felt this wasn't a function of our position 
Such tactics reek of totalitarianism ] as we understand this directive was given to all city and county employes 
To our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation 
We therefore considered the suggestion an insult to our intelligence ethics Bill of Rights etc 
Our only obligation for this day is to vote free of persuasion for the person we feel is capable in directing the public 
This is our duty  not as nurses or city employes  but as citizens of the United States 
Plus one shelters to the editor  Sir  I read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters 
Does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves but ready to demand that the community help and protect them 
Community shelters are of course necessary for those having no space for shelter 
If in a town of 2 000 private homes half of them have shelters the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent 
In designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home's occupants plus one  so he will be able to take in a stranger 
I hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart will get busy and be the first member of our plus one shelter club 
Escape to the editor  Sir  people continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer space 
It's simple enough from my point of view 
I am for it 
It is the only method left for a man to escape from a woman's world 
Supports Katanga to the editor  Sir  when the colonies decided upon freedom from England we insisted through the Declaration of Independence that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity 
It is high time the United States began to realize that the God given rights of men set forth in that document are applicable today to Katanga 
In the United Nations Charter the right of self determination is also an essential principle 
This again applies to Katanga 
The people of Katanga had fought for and obtained their freedom from the Communist yoke of Antoine Gizenga and his cohorts 
By political economic geographic and natural standards they were justified in doing so 
The United States and the U *n denounce their own principles when they defend the Communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of self determination of the Katangans 
County college costs to the editor  Sir  permit me to commend your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to 
The bill which passed the Assembly last May and is now pending in the Senate should be given careful scrutiny 
The procedure for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers 
Under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county college will be appointed  none will be elected 
The trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate 
This board will consist of two of the trustees of the college and the director and two members of the board of freeholders 
It will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders which shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed levied and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes 
The approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college 
Since two of these could be trustees of the college actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue 
This is taxation without representation 
Taxing improvements to the editor  Sir  your editorial Housing Speedup is certainly not the answer to our slum problems 
The very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions 
Change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties 
Then see what a boom in all trades as well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers will happen 
Our entire economy will have a terrific uplift 
Natural causes to the editor  Sir  an old man is kicked to death by muggers 
The medical examiner states that death was due to natural causes 
I once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in New York it is listed as death due to natural causes 
Praises exhibit to the editor  Sir  every resident of this city should visit the Newark Museum and see the exhibit Our Changing Skyline in Newark 
It will be at the museum until March 30 
It is a revelation of what has been done what is being done and what will be done in Newark as shown by architects' plans models and pictures 
It shows what a beautiful city Newark will become and certainly make every Newarker proud of this city 
It should also make him desire to participate actively in civic school and religious life of the community so that that phase of Newark will live up to the challenge presented by this exhibit 
Parkway courtesy to the editor  Sir  I hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the Garden State Parkway 
Recently I traveled the parkway from East Orange to Cape May and I found the most courteous group of men you will find anywhere 
One even gave my little dog a biscuit 
It was very refreshing 
Deep Peep Show the viewers of the Deep Peep Show at 15th and *j Streets N*w have an added attraction  the view of a fossilized cypress swamp 
Twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site a black coal like deposit has been encountered 
This is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress like trees were growing 
The fossilized remains of many of these trees are found embedded in the clay 
Some of the stumps are as much as three feet long but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments 
Although the wood has been changed to coal much of it still retains its original cell structure 
In the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at the time 
These microfossils indicate the swamp was formed during the Lower Cretaceous period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing 
The 15th Street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous Mayflower Hotel cypress swamp on 17th Street reported in The Washington Post August 2 1955 which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger 
Working for peace recently the secretary of the Friends Committee on National Legislation was interviewed on the air 
While I respect his sincere concern for peace he made four points that I would like to question 
1 
He said let's work for peace instead of protection from aggression 
I would ask why not do both 
Military power does not cause war  war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people 
Are we not late especially those of us who call ourselves Friends in doing enough about this lack of understanding 
2 
As to protection the speaker disapproved of shelters pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone 
Is this a reason for saving no one 
Would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone 
3 
The speaker suggested that the desolation of a post attack world would be too awful to face 
If the world comes to this wouldn't it be the very time when courage and American know how would be needed to help survivors rebuild 
Many of our young people think it would 
4 
Lastly the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it Civilian Defense 
In 1950 Public Law 920 created Civil Defense  different from Civilian groups of World War 2  a responsibility of the Government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster natural or manmade 
Far from creating fear as the speaker suggests preparedness  knowing what to do in an emergency  gives people confidence 
Civil Defense has far to go and many problems to solve but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster  storm flood accident or even war 
Pets in apartments it seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs 
I feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone's apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide 
In addition would not the young female public of Washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash 
I grant that the dog may not be really protective based on his training but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog 
I would like to suggest that the landlords and Commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments 
Sidewalk cafes use the terraces of the Capitol for a sidewalk cafe 
Could Senator Humphrey be serious in his proposal 
Is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists' comfort 
Perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended 
The Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials are rather bleak 
Why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat 
Unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season 
As an added suggestion to balance the budget the Government could sell advertising space on the Washington Monument 
It is visible throughout the city and men from Madison Ave would jump at the chance 
Sen Hubert Humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart 
He like most of us wants to be able to sit to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors 
Let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens 
Let us like the French have outdoor cafes where we may relax converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd 
Dissenting views of senators two strong dissents from the majority report of the Joint Economic Committee  May 2  by Senators Proxmire and Butler allege that the New Deal fiscal policy of the Thirties did not work 
For a neutral Germany Soviets said to fear resurgence of German militarism to the editor of the New York Times  for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity 
The United States and Soviet Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations 
Recent statements by well known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations 
President Kennedy was right when he said we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate 
I have just returned from a seven week trip to Europe and the Far East 
It is quite evident that the people of Western Europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war 
The fact is that the Italians French and British know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs 
We have no right to criticize them as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war 
We should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into Berlin 
It would be criminal folly if the Communists tried to prevent us 
But there is nothing we can do to stop Soviet Russia from granting de facto recognition to East Germany 
Soviet Russia has been invaded twice by German troops in a generation 
In the last war Russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated 
Probable agreement the truth is that Communist Russia fears the resurgence of German militarism 
Berlin is merely being used by Moscow as a stalking horse 
Actually the Communists out of fear of a united and armed Germany would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed Germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the U *n 
If the Communists are sincere in wanting a united neutral and disarmed Germany it might well be advantageous for the German people in this nuclear age 
It could provide security without cost of armaments and increase German prosperity and lessen taxation 
France and other Western European nations likewise fear a rearmed Germany 
If the German people favor such a settlement we should not oppose Germany following the example of Austria 
President Kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called Operation Survival which has many facets 
Why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed Germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the Big Four powers and the United States 
A united Germany freed of militarism might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world 
Meeting U *n obligations to the editor of the New York Times  in your editorial of Sept 30 The Smoldering Congo you make the following comment  far too many states are following the Russian example in refusing to pay their assessments 
It is up to the Assembly to take action against them 
They are violating their Charter obligation the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion 
I would like to quote from the Charter of the United Nations  Article 17 Section 1  the General Assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the Organization 
Section 2  the expenses of the Organization shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General Assembly 
Article 19  a Member of the United Nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years 
The U *s *s *r and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget 
But they refuse as do the Arab states to support the United Nations' expenses of maintaining the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East as a buffer between Egypt and Israel and the U *n troops in the Congo which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations but by a special budget 
According to the official interpretation of the Charter a member cannot be penalized by not having the right to vote in the General Assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the special United Nations' budgets and of course cannot be expelled from the Organization  which you suggested in your editorial  due to the fact that there is no provision in the Charter for expulsion 
To aid international law Connally amendment's repeal held step toward world order to the editor of the New York Times  in your Sept 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the First Session of the Eighty seventh Congress you referred to the lack of consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril 
Yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the Connally amendment to this country's domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the Statute of the International Court of Justice 
The Connally amendment says that the United States rather than the court shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States in a case before the World Court to which the United States is a party 
If the case is thus determined by us to be domestic the court has no jurisdiction 
Since the Connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the United States it also prevents us from using the court effectively 
Yet although the Kennedy Administration and the Eisenhower Administration before it have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the Connally amendment as contrary to our best interests no action has yet been taken 
Our destiny in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace with justice under law 
To achieve this destiny acts as well as words are needed  not only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect 
What better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the Connally amendment  an act which could expose the United States to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self judging attitude toward the court enable us to utilize it and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order 
We believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the Eighty seventh Congress should have included repeal by the Senate of the Connally amendment 
For better subway services to the editor of the New York Times  many home bound subway riders utilizing the Flushing *main Street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local departing from the Woodside station as their express comes to a stop leaving them stranded and strained 
To the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to Seventy fourth Street and change for the *j this takes a daily toll of time and temper 
The Transit Authority has recently placed in operation hold lights at *j Thirty ninth and Fifty ninth Street stations in Brooklyn 
This holds the local until the express passengers change trains 
Without question this time and temper saver should be immediately installed at the Woodside station 
Phone service criticized to the editor of the New York Times  as a business man I have to use the telephone constantly from three to four hours a day 
In the last few years the telephone company has managed to automate many areas of their service 
It has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing 
However there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone operators 
I have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing person to person calls special long distance calls etc 
Either it is lack of training lack of proper screening when hiring lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company which does have a Government blessed monopoly 
Fair priced funeral to the editor  I disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be government controlled 
The funeral for my husband was just what I wanted and I paid a fair price far less than I had expected to pay 
But the hospitals and doctors should be 
Helping retarded children to the editor  recently I visited the very remarkable Pilgrim School for retarded children 
Hazel Park donates its recreation center five days a week to the school 
There is no charge and no state aid 
Kiwanis American Legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring in dollars for its support 
There are 70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school 
Reading writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts as working in brass 
They make beautiful objects 
Enough trading stamps were collected to buy a 12 passenger station wagon 
Southfield schools furnish an old 45 passenger bus  the heater in which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat  
The school is located at 9 1/2 Mile Road Woodward Heights 
Visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do 
Jobs for Cavanagh to the editor  I was surprised at Mayor Miriani's defeat but perhaps Mayor elect Cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago 
Maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare *j and sanitation 
Negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great 
He should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night 
There should be better bus service and all of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling 
Our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and I have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case 
Drunken truck drivers in the city departments should be weeded out 
Educate the city employes to give real service to the public 
After all they are paid by the public they should be examples 
Church finds news features are helpful to the editor  at a recent meeting of the Women's Association of the Trumbull Ave United Presbyterian Church considerable use was made of material from The Detroit News on the King James version of the New Testament versus the New English Bible 
Some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration the Daily Prayer and Three Minutes A Day as being very helpful 
We feel that The Detroit News is to be complimented upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines 
Rude youngsters to the editor  thank you for the article by George Sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence 
How old do you have to be to remember when Americans especially children were encouraged to be polite 
Why has this form of gentility gone out of American life 
How can we old fashioned parents who still feel that adults are due some respect from children battle the new type of advertising that appears on *j without denying the children the use of television entirely 
Writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of modern parents they have observed 
From necessity they are also inspired by the hard sell attitude of the sponsor so finally it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising 
Dunes park advocate to the editor  I commend Senator Hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area 
Ghost town 
To the editor of the Inquirer  I just wish to congratulate Inspector Trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles 
We have now a quiet city fewer automobiles less congestion and fewer retail customers shopping in center city 
Good for Mr Trimmer 
Maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a ghost town 
Defends big trucks to the editor of the Inquirer  I worked on the Schuylkill Expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there wouldn't be an Expressway 
Without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future 
Mr George Hough  Oct 30  sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop 
The trucks today help pay for this highway 
They try to keep within the speed limits 
Although today's trucks are as fast as passenger cars a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road 
Out of school at 14 to the editor of the Inquirer  the letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed his letter simpleton instead of simplicitude 
Such kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden 
There are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates but not for the dropouts 
What we need is more vocational training in high schools not more dropouts 
Two wrongs to the editor of the Inquirer  I suppose I am missing some elementary point but I honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right ] I am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because Russia is 
Will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children 
If an atom bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it 
As I see it if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back the nuclear weapons we now have  at least the bombs  can inflict all the demage that is necessary 
Why do we need bigger and better bombs 
I repeat two wrongs do not make a right 
We tremble not to the editor of the Inquirer  everyone should take time to read Martin Luther's Hymn A Mighty Fortress Is Our God 
Especially the first half of the third verse  out of the race to the editor of the Inquirer  to our everlasting shame we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
Having led the world in this mad race I pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race 
Are we to be the master of the atom or will the atom be our master  and destroy us ] why trust Jagan 
To the editor of the Inquirer  just because Cheddi Jagan new boss of British Guiana was educated in the United States is no reason to think he isn't a Red 
We have quite a few home grown specimens of our own 
If we go all gooey over this newest Castro  until he proves he isn't  we've got rocks in our heads 
How many times must we get burned before we learn 
Russia and U *n to the editor of the Inquirer  just to remind the Communists that the bombs dropped on Japan were to end a war not start one 
The war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides 
Intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on Japan London or Pearl Harbor 
That is why the United Nations was formed so that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resorting to war 
Russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world 
Why aren't the Soviets expelled from the U *n 
Belated tribute to the editor of the Inquirer  while better late than never may have certain merits the posthumous award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the late Dag Hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation 
Had it been bestowed while the Secretary General of the United Nations was living unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult and in many ways thankless task 
According to one report however Mr Hammarskjold was considered too controversial a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring 
Actually of course that label controversial applied only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the Soviet Union 
At Khrushchev's door therefore can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated 
It is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed 
As has happened so often in the past the ability to recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy 
People to people to the editor of the Inquirer  just a brief note of appreciation to Vice President Johnson and Pakistani camel driver Bashir Ahmad for providing a first class example of people to people good will 
If only this could be done more often  with such heartening results  many of the earth's big problems would shrink to the insignificances they really are 
P *s 
Thanks for your good coverage of Ahmad's visit too ] expressway answer  East River Drive to the editor of the Inquirer  your continuing editorials concerning the Schuylkill Expressway are valuable  however several pertinent considerations deserve recognition 
One of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea 
We shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice 
They start on the East side of the Schuylkill have to cross over to the West to use the expressway and cross over again to the East at their destination 
Bridges tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings 
Each one of these is by its nature a focal point or a point of natural congestion 
We should avoid these congestion points or putting it another way keep cars starting and ending on the East side of the river  on the East side 
This can be accomplished by several logical steps   1  widen the East River Drive at least one lane 
 2  so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems 
 3  paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges 
One additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the East River Drive by fifty percent 
 4  this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the Schuylkill Expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the East River Drive 
Shadow over Washington Square to the editor of the Inquirer  I wish to advocate two drastic changes in Washington Square  1 
Take away George Washington's statue 
2 
Replace it with the statue of one or another of the world's famous dictators 
There's no sense in being reminded of times that were 
Washington Square seems not part of a free land 
It may remind one of Russia China or East Berlin  but it can't remind one of the freedom that Washington and the Continental soldiers fought for 
The Fairmount Park Commission will no doubt approve my two proposals because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the Square 
The matter may seem a small thing to some people I know but it's a very good start on the road to Totalitarianism the Commission has posted signs in Washington Square saying  the feeding of birds is prohibited in this square 
Fairmount Park Commission does each tentacle of the octopus of City Government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance 
If birds don't belong in a square or park what does 
They are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature 
The trees are their homes  but the Commission does not share such sentiments 
The whole official City apparently has an intense hatred toward birds 
Starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon from City Hall 
Just a preliminary measure 
If any are left presently we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too 
The City Government is not united in an all out to the death drive to stamp out gangs delinquents thugs murderers rapists subversives 
Indeed no 
Let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on John and Jane Doe lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive 
Of course in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because we're afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say how come 
What's your motive 
Who wants this deed done 
  in this small way do the leaders of a city or of a nation inure the masses to watching or even inflicting torture and death upon even their fellow men 
One means to help the birds occurs to me  let the chimes that ring over Washington Square twice daily discontinue any piece of music but one 
Let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began the hymn Abide With Me 
We will know and He will know to whom it is rendered what the birds would ask  not push ups but stand ups to the editor of the Inquirer  there is a trend today to bemoan the fact that Americans are too soft 
Unfortunately those who would remedy our softness seek to do so with calisthenics 
They are working on the wrong part of our anatomy 
It is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft 
Ashamed of our wealth and power afraid of so called world opinion and addicted to peace we have allowed our soft heartedness to lead to soft headed policies 
When we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self determination when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own Nation when we recognize that our enemy is Communism not war and when we realize that concessions to Communists do not insure peace or freedom then and only then will we no longer be soft 
America doesn't need to push up she needs to stand up ] disputes Stans column business scandal views to the editor  the new column by Maurice Stans regarding business scandals is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit 
However he states unequivocally the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor 
I must in fairness take issue with his premise primarily because the so called scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals 
The area most prominently commented on during the Mc*clellan hearings had to do with sweetheart contracts 
These arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes 
A sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute 
Anyone familiar with the details of the Mc*clellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders 
Further it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by Congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the Landrum *griffin Act 
Escalation unto death the nuclear war is already being fought except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets  not yet 
It is being fought moreover in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories 
They predicted escalation and escalation is what we are getting 
The biggest nuclear device the United States has exploded measured some 15 megatons although our *j are said to be carrying two 20 megaton bombs apiece 
Some time ago however Mr Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made the Soviet Union would make them 
He seems to have at least a few 30 and 50 megaton bombs on hand since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock 
And now of course the hue and cry for counter escalation is being raised on our side 
Khrushchev threatens us with a 100 megaton bomb 
So be it  then we must embark on a crash program for 200 megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety and neutron bombs which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing 
So escalation proceeds ad infinitum or more accurately until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds 
What is needed Philip Morrison writes in The Cornell Daily Sun  October 26  is a discontinuity 
The escalation must end sometime and probably quite soon 
Only a discontinuity can end it Professor Morrison writes 
The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction or that of diplomatic policy 
Morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet Union or Red China it is the most vulnerable of the great powers  Europe of course must be written off out of hand 
He feels therefore that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United States is the least risky path our government can take 
His proposal is opposed to that of Richard Nixon Governor Rockefeller past chairmen Strauss and Mc*cone of the Atomic Energy Commission Dr Edward Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war 
These gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing  in the atmosphere  on the greatest possible scale all in the name of national security 
Escalation is their first love and their last  they will be faithful unto death 
Capable as their minds may be in some directions these guardians of the nation's security are incapable of learning or even of observing 
If this capacity had not failed them they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation 
He has gained only one thing  he has exploded a 50 megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges 
But if his purpose was to inspire terror his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously 
Not terror but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the Soviet sphere 
Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps 
When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another it is only natural 
Thus when the Russians sent up their first sputnik American chagrin was human enough and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable 
But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly 
The tide turns when East Germans fled to the West by the thousands paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists 
They are less vocal now when it is the West Berliners who are migrating 
The flood is not as great  only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative account  but it is symptomatic 
West Berlin morale is low and in age distribution the situation is unfavorable 
Nearly 18 per cent of West Berlin's 2 200 000 residents are sixty five or older only 12 8 per cent are under fifteen 
R H S Crossman M *p  writing in The Manchester Guardian states that departures from West Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700 but of 1 700 a week and applications to leave have risen to 1 900 a week 
The official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers or independent professional people 
Whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead 
The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from West Germany but the hard truth says Crossman is that The closing off of East Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East German as distinct from Russian troops was a major Communist victory which dealt West Berlin a deadly possibly a fatal blow 
The gallant half city is dying on its feet 
Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in The Observer  London  
Mark Arnold *foster writes  people are leaving  West Berlin  because they think it is dying 
They are leaving so fast that the president of the West German Employers' Federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the West to volunteer for six months' front line work in factories in West Berlin 
Berlin's resilience is amazing but if it has to hire its labor in the West the struggle will be hard indeed 
The handwriting is on the wall 
The only hope for West Berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city 
State Department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary and driving two blocks into East Berlin under military escort will not avail 
Tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful 
The materials for compromise are at hand  the Nation Walter Lippmann and other sober commentators  see Alan Clark on p 367  have spelled them out again and again 
A compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph but it will save Berlin 
Or the city can be a graveyard monument to Western intransigence if that is what the West wants 
Vacancy the removal of Stalin's body from the mausoleum he shared with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in the Kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history 
It is in fact a relatively mild chastisement of the dead 
A British writer Richard Haestier in a book Dead Men Tell Tales recalls that in the turmoil preceding the French Revolution the body of Henry 4 who had died nearly 180 years earlier was torn to pieces by a mob 
And in England after the Restoration the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn 
The head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows 
Contemplating these posthumous punishments Stalin should not lose all hope 
In 1899 Parliament erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster facing Whitehall and there presumably he still stands 
Nikita Khrushchev however has created yet another problem for himself 
The Lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy Moscow is a crowded city and the creed of Communism deplores waste 
Who will take Stalin's place beside Lenin 
There is Karl Marx of course buried in London 
The Macmillan government might be willing to let him go but he has been dead seventy eight years and even the Soviet morticians could not make him look presentable 
Who then is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin 
Who but Nikita himself 
Since he has just shown who is top dog he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the Soviet people 
Besides he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which what with exhumations and rehabilitations seems to match that of life 
Suppose he did lie beside Lenin would it be permanent 
If some future Khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession 
When a man is laid to rest he is entitled to stay put 
If Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery everyone will understand 
U Thant of Burma the appointment of U Thant of Burma as the U *n 's Acting Secretary General  at this writing the choice appears to be certain  offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends 
Mongi Slim of Tunisia and Frederick Boland of Ireland were early favorites in the running but France didn't like the former and the Soviet Union would have none of the latter 
With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr Hammarskjold U Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto 
What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy 
In all the bitter in fighting the squabbles over election procedures the complicated numbers game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries' theme the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat 
He has moreover another qualification which augurs well for the future 
He is a Buddhist which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung 
U Thant of course will hold office until the spring of 1963 when Mr Hammarskjold's term would have come to an end 
Whether the compromises  on both sides  that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen 
Mr Khrushchev's demand for a troika is dormant not dead  the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U Thant represents 
In a sense the showdown promised by Mr Hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been avoided  no precedents have been set as yet  structurally the U *n is still fluid vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it 
But at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong 
To the hills girls 
No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade 
These are mentalities which crave action  and they are beginning to get it as Messrs Salsich and Engh report on page 372 
Even in areas where political connotations are  deliberately 
 left vague the spirit of vigilantism is spreading 
Friends a picture magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the Gulf Telephone Company at Foley Alabama 
If the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast the account reads they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando trained telephone employees  all girls 
Heavily armed and mobilized as a fast moving Civil Defense outfit 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a minute's notice 
According to Friends the unit was organized by John Snook a former World War 2 commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company 
The girls very fetching in their uniforms are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck  they are also trained with carbines automatic weapons pistols rifles and other such ladies' accessories 
This may be opera bouffe now but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy 
The country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means 
The doctrine has never worked  it is not working now 
The official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms  it cannot bring them into actual play 
A more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined 
As the civic temper rises the more naive citizens begin to play soldier  but the guns are real 
Soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst 
All false gods resemble Moloch at least in the early phases of their careers so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice 
But there is reason in all things and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor car is exceeding all bounds in its demands 
The annual butchery of 40 000 American men women and children to satiate its blood lust is excessive  a quota of 25 000 a year would be more than sufficient 
No other popular idol is accorded even that much grace 
If the railroads for example regularly slaughtered 25 000 passengers each year the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the United States 
But by comparison with the railroad the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily 
Yet it is plainly time to make a start and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic without being fanatical 
Here then is what Swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning 
From next New Year's Day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways publicizing it on all media of communication 
To avoid suspicion of bigotry let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat wagon has picked up the twenty five thousandth corpse  but let the twenty five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners 
Then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on July 4 1963 
The scene of course should be nine miles northwest of Centralia Illinois the geographical center of population according to the census 
A special grandstand protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of Illinois should be erected for occupancy by honored guests who should include the ambassadors of all those new African nations as yet not quite convinced that the United States is thoroughly civilized 
The band should play the Rogues' March as a processional switching to Hail Columbia Happy Land ] as the trap is sprung 
Independence Day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the American article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights the first of which is life and when any government becomes subversive of that end it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it 
The highway system is an agency of government and when it grinds up 40 000 Americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do 
Hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens which would certainly alter it and definitely for the better 
Moreover the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political but at least partially and perhaps primarily social 
It would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices  for instance the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis or as it is generally termed staying put 
True the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor even a miniscule sect and their credo home keeping hearts are happiest is as disreputable as Socinianism 
Nonetheless although few in number they are a stubborn crew as tenacious of life as the Hardshell Baptists which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith 
Perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of Tarheelia Robert Ruark's grandfather who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is all this gallivantin' 
In any event the yearly sacrifice of 40 000 victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most ardent faith 
Somehow our contemporary Moloch must be induced to see reason 
Since appeals to morality to humanity and to sanity have had such small effect perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example 
If we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive say beyond 25 000 per annum then somebody is going to hang it follows that the more eminent the victim the more impressive the lesson 
To hang 50 governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related to the highways  so all things considered the highway commissioners would seem to be elected 
As the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth the Soviet Union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race 
But the guilt is shared by the United States Britain and France the other members of the atomic club 
Until Moscow resumed nuclear testing last September 1 the *j and *j had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the Russians and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down 
As it descends the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body  for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies 
The effect of radiation is cumulative over the years  and on to succeeding generations 
So while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the West were so quick to assume when Mr Khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat 
Shock dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions  a holier than thou sermon was not 
On October 19 after the Soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices Ambassador Stevenson warned the *j General Assembly that this country in self protection might have to resume above ground tests 
More recently the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Dr Glenn T Seaborg admitted to a news conference in Las Vegas Nevada that the *j might fall behind Russia  he apparently meant in weapons development  if the Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain 
The trial balloons are afloat 
All of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood 
But for the average citizen unfortunately this is one of science's worst marked channels full of tricky currents and unknown depths 
The scientists in and out of government do not agree on some of the most vital points at least publicly 
On the one hand the Public Health Service declared as recently as October 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the Soviet shots do not warrant undue public concern or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the *j 
But the *j conceded that the new radioactive particles will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the United States 
Then it added  it is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be  nor how many people will be affected 
Having hedged its bets in this way *j apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all  at present radiation levels and even at somewhat higher levels the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected 
Then to conclude on an indeterminate note  nevertheless if fallout increased substantially or remained high for a long time it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world 
Dr Linus Pauling a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry has been less ambiguous whether you choose to agree with him or not 
After declaring in an article last month in Frontier Magazine that the Russian testing carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new Soviet shots totaled 200 megatons  the damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations 160 000 children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects 
Long lived carbon 14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations and between 200 000 and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiation produced diseases such as leukemia 
Most of these would be in the Northern Hemisphere where the fallout is concentrating 
Pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of Russian tests will probably turn out to be too high but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility 
The lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups from which agreed on generalizations could be drawn 
But more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem 
Its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing 
An illustration of this attitude is found in John A Mc*cone's letter to Dr Thomas Lauritsen reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the New Republic 
To this day the Atomic Energy Commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout 
A recent study on radiation exposure by the *j division of biology and medicine stated  the question of the biological effect of  radiation  doses is not considered herein 
Of course the *j is in a bind now 
If it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout it will box the President on resuming atmospheric tests 
So the Commission's announcements of the new Soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences with the fission yield usually left vague 
Now of course that the Russians are the nuclear villains radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid when the *j was testing in the atmosphere 
The prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout if not exactly good for you might not be much worse than a bad cold 
After a nuclear blast one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof 
Things aren't that simple anymore 
Yet if Washington gets too indignant about Soviet fallout it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if America decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count 
How much fallout will we get 
As of October 25 the *j had reported 24 shots in the new Soviet series 12 of them in a megaton range including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons  the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of *j   and President Kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported 
Assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the Japanese at 10 megatons a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons 
Some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons and that the full 50 megaton bomb that Khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated 
If the new Soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous Russian tests the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion meaning a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far 
To this must be added the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three power test moratorium that began in November 1958 
Resuming atmospheric tests one of the inescapable realities of the Cold War is that it has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas 
The first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself 
That dilemma is as much with us as ever 
The second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of Soviet tests 
When this second dilemma first became obvious  during the mid to late '50's  the United States appeared to have three choices 
It could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations 
It could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist world domination 
Or it could have chosen to find  by negotiation  some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security 
This third choice was in fact made 
With the resumption of Soviet testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks however the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken 
Once again the United States must choose 
And once again the choices are much the same 
Only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder 
The first choice abandoning tests entirely would not only be unpopular domestically but would surely be exploited by the Russians 
The second choice full testing has become even more risky just because the current Soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere 
The third choice negotiation presupposes as Russian behavior demonstrates a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable 
We take the position however that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us 
It is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable 
Its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice  one which should it fail will not have contaminated the conscience 
That is the contamination we most fear 
Leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice 
For that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent Americans are now proposing 
In particular Governor Nelson Rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests 
Speaking recently in Miami Governor Rockefeller said that to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent Soviet tests we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests 
Taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion he argued that the responsibility of the United States is to do confidently and firmly not what is popular but what is right 
What was missing in the Governor's argument as in so many similar arguments was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right 
The possibility as he asserted that the Russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise  unless of course we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand 
Besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the Governor's case one can ask seriously whether our lead over the Russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary 
Recent statements by the President and Defense Department spokesmen have to the contrary assured us that our lead is very great 
Unless the Administration and the Defense Department have been deceiving us the facts do not support the assertion that we are compelled to resume atmospheric testing 
It is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may at some point in the future be necessary and even justifiable 
But a resumption does not seem justifiable now 
What we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the Soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations 
We now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake 
This is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of Communism 
Too often in the past Russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part 
There ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what Russia does 
The refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start 
Ecumenical hopes when his Holiness Pope John 23 first called for an Ecumenical Council and at the same time voiced his yearning for Christian unity the enthusiasm among Catholic and Protestant ecumenicists was immediate 
With good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided Christendom 
But as the more concrete plans for the work of the Council gradually became known there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides 
The Council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the Church 
As it has turned out however the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses 
Two things have happened in recent months to bring the Council into perspective  each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy 
First of all it is now known that Pope John sees the renewal and purification of the Church as an absolutely necessary step toward Christian unity 
Far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task the Pontiff believes that a revivified Church is required in order that the whole world may see Catholicism in the best possible light 
Equally significant Pope John has said that Catholics themselves bear some responsibility for Christian disunity 
A major aim of the Council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the Church today stands in the way of unity 
Secondly a whole series of addresses and actions by the Pope and by others show that concern for Christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the Church 
The establishment by the Holy Father of a permanent Secretariat for Christian Unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern 
The designation of five Catholic theologians to attend the World Council of Churches assembly in New Delhi as official observers reverses the Church's earlier stand 
The public appeal by the new Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Cicognani for renewed efforts toward Eastern and Western reunion was still another remarkable act 
Nor can one forget Pope John's unprecedented meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury 
Augustin Cardinal Bea the director of the Secretariate for Christian Unity has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the Church's stance toward the Protestant and Orthodox Churches 
Noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone 
For discouragement or the temptation to abandon our efforts would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of God the irresistible efficacy of prayer the action of Christ or the power of the Divine Spirit 
Can any Christian fail to respond to these words 
The budget deficit the administration's official budget review which estimates a 6 9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year isn't making anyone happy 
Certainly it isn't making the President happy and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year 
We sympathize with Mr Kennedy but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesn't please us either although for very different reasons 
Furthermore we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring 
In the first place a large part of the discrepancy between President Eisenhower's estimate of a 1 5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing President's farewell gift of a political booby trap to his successor 
The Eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received 
The rest of the deficit is also easily understood 
Four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense an expenditure necessitated by the penny wise policies of the Eisenhhower Administration quite apart from the recent crises in Berlin and elsewhere 
Four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program a responsibility similarly neglected by Mr Eisenhower 
The farm program will cost an additional 1 5 billion because of unusual weather factors the Food for Peace program and other new measures 
Anti recession programs  aid for the unemployed their children and for depressed areas  account for only 900 million of the 6 9 billion dollar deficit 
Our complaint is that in many crucial areas the Kennedy programs are not too large but too small most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build up and in aid and welfare measures 
And yet Mr Kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of tightening up and economizing 
We wish the President would remember that fiscal responsibility was the battle cry of the party that lost the election 
The party that won used to say something about a New Frontier 
Ethics and peace introduction of the dialogue principle proved strikingly effective at the thirty fourth annual meeting of the Catholic Association for International Peace in Washington the last weekend in October 
Two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent Protestants and when the speaker was a Catholic one discussant on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion 
Several effects were immediately evident 
Sessions devoted to Ethics and Foreign Policy Trends Moral Principle and Political Judgment Christian Ethics in the Cold War and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if Catholics were merely talking to themselves 
Usually questions from the floor were directed to the non *catholic speaker or discussion leader 
In the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion on the natural law which Dr William V O'*brien of Georgetown University advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy 
That Aristotelean *thomistic principle experienced a thorough going over from a number of the participants but in the end the concept came to reassert itself 
Speakers declared that Protestants often make use of it if perhaps by some other name 
A Lebanese Moslem told about its existence and application in the Islamic tradition as the divine law while a C *a *i *p member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new U *n nations told of its widespread recognition on the African continent 
The impression was unmistakable that whatever one may choose to call it natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence 
Another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself 
The stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable 
It was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other's positions and better comprehension of one's own 
But a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues 
One effect of the spirited give and take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts  knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest tactical atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use  to defend Berlin for example  the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account  it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the Christian imperative 
Everywhere I went in Formosa I asked the same question 
I was searching for an accent of self delusion or even of hypocrisy 
I never found it among any of the Chinese with whom I spoke though granted they were almost all members of the official family who presumably harbor official thoughts 
But I questioned also professional soldiers who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian's dreamy irredentism 
Their answer was  it can be done and we will do it 
And then I put the question as pointedly as I could directly to Chiang Kai shek  in America I said practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re enter the Mainland 
What evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that and that it can be done 
He smiled 
 he always smiles  at least at visitors I gather 
He smiled also at a British bloke seated next to me who asked the most asinine questions 
I recalled sympathetically the Duke's complaint in Browning's My Last Duchess 
 he smiled and said a word or two to the interpreter who turned to me the President wonders where you are going after you leave Taipei 
That I smarted is a royal rebuff if ever there was one 
I answered the routine question about my itinerary rather coolly 
Chiang spoke again this time at greater length 
The President says the translator came in that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in Southeast Asia and that everywhere you went you would seek the answer to your question 
He says that if he were to express to you once again his own profound determination to go to the Mainland and his faith that that return is feasible he would merely sound redundant 
So you yourself must seek these objective data and come to your own conclusions 
Any information we have here in Taiwan is at your disposal 
Fair enough 
What are the relevant data 
For every person on Taiwan there are sixty in Mainland China 
If the raw population figures are crucially relevant then it is idle to think of liberation as idle as to suppose that Poland might liberate Russia 
Relative military manpower 
Less than 60 1 but at least 6 1 
The estimates vary widely on the strength of the Chinese army 
Say four million 
The armed forces of Taiwan are at a working strength of about 450 000 though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated 
Skill 
Training 
Morale 
It is generally conceded that the Formosan air force is the best by far in Asia and the army the best trained 
The morale is very high 
Even so it adds up to impossible odds except that the question arises on whose side would the Mainland Chinese army fight 
The miserable people of China the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play cannot themselves resist overtly 
They think perforce of physical survival  everything else is secondary 
But the army which Mao continues to feed well where are its sympathies 
The psychological strategists in Taiwan stress the great sense of family cultivated in China over thousands of years 
It has not been extirpated by ten years of Communist depersonalization 
Every soldier in the army has somewhere relatives who are close to starvation 
The soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion it is assumed  but will their discontent spread to the officer class 
The immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed  a despot does not economize on his generals 
But there are the cousins and aunts and nephews 
Their privations are almost beyond endurance 
In behalf of what 
Leninism *marxism as understood by Exegete Mao 
To whom will the generals stay loyal 
There is little doubt if they had a secret ballot they would vote for food for their family in place of ideological purity out on the farm 
It is another question whether they  or a single general off in a corner of China secure for a few  galvanizing 
 days at least from instant retaliation  will defy the Party 
But the disposition to rebel is most definitely there 
But there must be a catalytic pressure 
The military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes which together may prove fatal 
The first was the commune program which will ensure agricultural poverty for years 
The family is largely broken up  and where it is not it is left with no residue and the social meaning of this is enormous 
For it is the family that in China has always provided social security for the indigent the sick the down and out members of the clan 
Now the government must do that  but the government is left with no reserve granary under the agricultural system it has ordained 
Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security 
The second mistake is Tibet 
Tibet has historically served China as a buffer state 
A friendly state sometimes only semi independent but never hostile 
China never tried to integrate Tibet by extirpating the people's religion and institutions 
Red China is trying to do this and she is not likely ever to succeed 
Tibet is too vast the terrain is too difficult 
Tibet may bleed China as Algeria is bleeding France 
These continuing pressures social economic and military are doing much to keep China in a heightening state of tension 
The imposition of yet another pressure a strong one from the outside might cause it to snap 
The planners in Taiwan struck me as realistic men 
They know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control 
First and foremost they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the Communist regime 
On these they feel they can rely 
Secondly they depend on America's moral cooperation when the crucial moment arrives 
They hope that if history vouchsafes the West another Budapest we will receive the opportunity gladly 
I remarked jocularly to the President that the future of China would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected American Liberals to Quemoy on an odd day 
He affected  most properly  not to understand my point 
But he  and all of China  wears the scars of American indecisiveness and he knows what an uncertain ally we are 
We have been grand to Formosa itself  lots of aid and most of the time a policy of support for the offshore islands 
But our outlook has been and continues to be defensive 
A great deal depends on the crystallization of Mr Kennedy's views on the world struggle 
The Free Chinese know that the situation on the Mainland is in flux and are poised to strike 
There is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation 
The moment of truth is the moment of crisis 
During the slow buildup the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details fine words strutting gestures 
The crisis burns these suddenly away 
There the truth is open to eyes that are willing to look 
The moment passes 
New self deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too naked bones 
A truth revealing crisis erupted in Katanga for a couple of days this month to be quickly smothered by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies 
Before memory too clouds over let us make a note or two of what could be seen 
The measure was instantly taken as always in such cases of public men at many levels 
One knows better now who has bone and who has jelly in his spine 
But I am here concerned more with policy than with men 
Public men come and go but great issues of policy remain 
Now everyone knows  or knew in the week of December 10  that something had gone shockingly wrong with American foreign policy 
The United States was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most pro *western and anti *communist within any of the new nations  the only place in Africa moreover where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved 
Of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the United Nations 
But in the moment of truth everyone could see that the U *s was in reality the principal 
The moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our *j allies to the entire Western community 
By our policy the West was  is  split 
But the key revelation is not new 
The controlling pattern was first displayed in the Hungary *suez crisis of November 1956 
It reappears in whole or part whenever a new crisis exposes the reality  in Cuba last spring  with which the Dominican events of last month should be paired   at the peaks of the nuclear test and the Berlin cycles  in relation to Laos Algeria South Africa  right now with almost cartoon emphasis in the temporally linked complex of Tshombe *gizenga *goa *ghana 
What the moments reveal this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows  under prevailing policy the U *s can take the initiative against the Right but cannot take the initiative against the Left 
It makes no difference what part of the world is involved what form of regime what particular issue 
The U *s cannot take the initiative against the Left 
There is even some question whether the U *s can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the Left 
We can attack Tshombe but not Gigenza 
No matter that Gizenga is Moscow's man in the Congo 
No matter that it is his troops who rape Western women and eat Western men 
No matter that the Katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of Western interests in Africa 
 even granted that the Congo should be unified you don't protect Western security by first removing the pro *western weight from the power equilibrium 
 we can force Britain and France out of the Suez but we cannot so much as try to force the Russian tanks back from Budapest 
We can mass our fleet against the Trujillos but not against the Castros 
We can vote in the *j against South African apartheid or Portuguese rule in Angola but we cannot even introduce a motion on the Berlin Wall  much less give the simple order to push the Wall down 
We officially receive the anti *french Moscow allied Algerian *j but we denounce the pro *europe anti *communist *j as criminal 
In the very week of our war against Katanga we make a $133 million grant to Kwame Nkrumah who has just declared his solidarity with the Communist bloc and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship 
As our planes land the war materiel that kills pro *western Katangans we stand supinely bleating while Nehru's troops smash into a five hundred year old district of our *j ally Portugal 
What explains this uni directional paralysis 
It is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international  and in some degree our domestic  policy 
The Suez *hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new Administration but only made more consistent and more active 
Key to the puzzles most immediately relevant to these episodes in Goa Katanga and Ghana as to the Suez *hungary crisis before them is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of Asia Africa and Latin America 
From this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the uncommitted  neutralist contested  nations especially on those whose leaders make the most noise  Nehru Tito Nkrumah Sukarno Betancourt etc 
Our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes 
If we grasp this orientation as a key our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible 
And it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the Left 
Broadway the unoriginals to write a play the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it 
Nowadays more and more all he needs is someone else's book 
To get started he does not scan the world about him  he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists 
So far this season Broadway's premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original American stage plays 
Best from abroad 
Of straight dramas there are All The Way Home which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee novel A Death In The Family  The Wall awkwardly based on the John Hersey novel  Advise And Consent lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller  Face Of A Hero  closed  based on a Pierre Boulle novel 
The only original works attempting to reach any stature  Tennessee Williams' disappointing domestic comedy Period Of Adjustment and Arthur Laurents' clever but empty Invitation To A March 
Clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals  A Taste Of Honey by Britain's young  19 when she wrote it  Shelagh Delaney  Becket by France's Jean Anouilh  The Hostage  closed  by Ireland's Brendan Behan 
Among the musicals Camelot came from T H White's The Once And Future King and novels were the sources of the less than momentous Tenderloin and Do Re Mi 
Wildcat and The Unsinkable Molly Brown were originals but pretty bad leaving top honors again to an import  the jaunty and charmingly French Irma La Douce 
The only other works at least technically original were dreary farces  Send Me No Flowers  closed  Under The Yum *yum Tree Critic's Choice 
In the forthcoming The Conquering Hero and Carnival Broadway is not even adapting books but reconverting old movies  Hail The Conquering Hero and Lili  
Dry of life 
Originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad 
Some memorable plays have been drawn from books notably Life With Father and Diary Of Anne Frank 
And particularly in the musical field adaptations have long been the rule from Die Fledermaus and The Merry Widow to Oklahoma and My Fair Lady 
As critic Walter Kerr points out  adaptations so long as they are good still qualify as creative 
And other defenders invariably argue that after all Shakespeare and Moliere were adapters too 
The difference is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and filled it with their own world  most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book squeeze it dry of life and add only one contribution of their own  stage technique 
The most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports is increasing production expense  producers cannot afford to take chances 
But that explanation is only partly true 
Off *broadway where production is still comparatively cheap is proving itself only slightly more original 
Laudably enough it is offering classics and off beat imports but last week only one U *s original was on the boards Robert D Hock's stunning Civil War work Borak 
The real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of U *s playwrights 
Nightclubs the Cooch Terpers he  come with me to the Casbah 
She  by subway or cab 
That exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in Manhattan as more and more New Yorkers were discovering 29th Street and Eighth Avenue where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like Arabian Nights Grecian Palace and Egyptian Gardens are the American inpost of belly dancing 
Several more will open soon 
Their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd Street burlesque joints but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial  neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis 
The belly boites with their papier mache palm trees or hand painted Ionic columns heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of Greek and Turkish families 
Customers often bring their children  between performances enthusiastic young men from the audience will take the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces 
Except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager Greek sailor the people watch in calm absorption 
Small shirt sleeved orchestras play in 2/4 or 4/4 time using guitars violins and more alien instruments with names that would open Sesame  the oud grandfather of the lute  the darbuka a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass  the def a low pitched tambourine 
The girls sit quietly with the musicians wearing prim dresses or plain secretarial shifts until it is time to go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem 
Continuum of mankind 
If a dancer is good she suggests purely and superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny  the continuum of mankind 
But a great many of what Variety calls the Cooch Terpers are considerably less cosmic than that 
Each dancer follows the ancient Oriental pattern  she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates and through breathing and muscle control she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room 
This is done at varying speeds ranging from the slow and fast Shifte Telli  a musical term meaning double strings  to the fastest ecstatic Karshilama  meaning greetings or welcome  
The New York dancers are highly eclectic varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations back bends or floor crawls 
But they do not strip 
The striptease is crass  the belly dance leaves more to the imagination 
When a dancer does well she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills  although the Manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers' costumes 
With tips the girls average between $150 and $200 a week depending on basic salary 
Although they are forbidden to sit with the customers the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks and most of them can bolt one down in mid shimmy 
The melting pot 
All over the country belly clubs have never been bigger especially in Detroit Boston and Chicago and even in small towns  one of the best dancers a Turkish girl named Semra works at a roadhouse outside Bristol Conn 
The girls are kept booked and moving by several agents notably voluble black bearded Murat Somay a Manhattan Turk who is the Sol Hurok of the central abdomen 
He can offer nine Turkish girls plans to import at least 15 more 
But a great many of the dancers are more or less native 
Sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis conducted by Lebanese and Syrians in the U *s  where they dance with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs 
As the girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins the melting pot has never bubbled more intriguingly 
Some Manhattan examples  Jemela  surname  Gerby  23 seems Hong Kong Oriental but has a Spanish father and an Indian mother was born in America and educated at Holy Cross Academy and Textile High School says she learned belly dancing at family picnics 
Serene  Mrs Wilson  23 was born in Budapest and raised in Manhattan 
Daughter of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance she is one of the few really beautiful girls in the New York Casbah with dark eyes and dark waist length hair the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe glimmering body 
Many belly dancers are married but Serene is one of the few who will admit it 
Marlene  surname  Adamo  25 a Brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from Arabic friends in Paris now lives on Manhattan's West Side is about the best belly dancer working the Casbah loves it so much that she dances on her day off 
She has the small highly developed body of a prime athlete and holds in contempt the girls who just move sex 
Leila  Malia Phillips  25 is a Greenwich Village painter of Persianesque miniatures who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles 
A graduate of Hollywood High School she likes to imagine herself as she takes the floor a village girl coming in to a festival 
Gloria  surname  Ziraldo  circa 30 who was born in Italy and once did chorus work in Toronto has been around longer than most of the others wistfully remembers the old days when we used to get the seamen from the ships you know with big turtleneck sweaters and handkerchiefs and all 
But the ships are very slow now and we don't get so many sailors any more 
The uptown crowd has moved in and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck sweater for a button down collar 
A short tormented span of the handful of painters that Austria has produced in the 20th century only one Oskar Kokoschka is widely known in the U *s 
This state of unawareness may not last much longer 
For ten years a small group of European and U *s critics has been calling attention to the half forgotten Austrian expressionist Egon Schiele who died 42 years ago at the age of 28 
The critics' campaign finally inspired the first major U *s exhibit of Schiele's works 
The show has been to Boston and Manhattan will in time reach Pittsburgh and Minneapolis 
Last week it opened at the J B Speed Museum in Louisville at the very moment that a second Schiele exhibit was being made ready at the Felix Landau gallery in Los Angeles 
Schiele's paintings are anything but pleasant 
His people  see color  are angular and knobby knuckled sometimes painfully stretched sometimes grotesquely foreshortened 
His colors are dark and murky and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom 
But he painted some of the boldest and most original pictures of his time and even after nearly half a century the tense tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its fascination 
The devil himself 
The son of a railway stationmaster Schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy Danubian town of Tulln 14 miles northwest of Vienna 
He was an emotional lonely boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely any schoolwork 
When he was 15 his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna 
Even there he did not last for long 
Cried one professor after a few months of Student Schiele's tantrums and rebellion  the devil himself must have defecated you into my classroom ] for a while his work was influenced deeply by the French impressionists and by the patterned mosaic like paintings of Gustav Klimt then the dean of Austrian art 
Gradually Schiele evolved a somber style of his own  and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter 
His pictures were roundly denounced as the most disgusting things one has ever seen in Vienna 
He himself was once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for 24 days  the first three of which he spent desperately trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle 
For years he wore hand me down suits and homemade paper collars was even driven to scrounging for cigarette butts in Vienna's gutters 
Drafted into the Austrian army he rebelliously rejected discipline wangled a Vienna billet went on painting 
It was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show 
Melancholy obsession 
The unabashed sexuality of so many of his paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at bay  his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy and it was too much even for morbid minded Vienna 
He was obsessed by disease and poverty by the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust 
The children he painted were almost always in rags his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness and his nudes  including several self portraits  were stringy contorted and strangely pathetic 
The subject he liked most was the female body which he painted in every state  naked half dressed muffled to the ears sitting primly in a chair lying tauntingly on a bed or locked in an embrace 
The most surprising thing about the Twenty second Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is that it is surprising  perhaps quite as much in its own way as the Twentieth Congress of 1956 which ended with that famous secret report on Stalin 
The publication last July of the party's Draft Program  that blueprint for the transition to communism  had led the uninitiated to suppose that this Twenty second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the Khrushchev regime a solemn consecration of ideas which had in fact been current over the last three or four years  i e  since the defeat of the anti party group  in all theoretical party journals 
These never ceased to suggest that if in the eyes of Marx and Lenin full communism was still a very distant ideal the establishment of a Communist society had now under Khrushchev become an immediate and tangible reality 
It seems that Khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world shaking contribution to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program  a large part of his twelve hour speech at the recent Congress was in fact very largely a rehash of that interminable document  
He and other Soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an All People's State and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater democratization of the whole hierarchy of Soviets starting with the Supreme Soviet itself 
Their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at bureaucracy and would enable the people to take a more direct and active part in running the country 
Also elections would be more democratic  there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from 
No doubt there was still a lot in the Draft Program  and in Khrushchev's speech  which left many points obscure 
Was it the party's intention for example to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage earning kolkhozes i e  state farms  which were moreover to be progressively urbanized  
As we know the Soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot  and it is still very far from certain how valid the party's claim is that in a growing number of kolkhozes the peasants are finding it more profitable to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm 
If one follows the reports of the Congress one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter 
The Draft Program was interesting in other respects too 
It contained for example a number of curious admissions about the peasants who enjoy no sickness benefits no old age pensions no paid holidays  they still benefit far less than the other 50 per cent of the nation from that welfare state which the Soviet Union so greatly prides itself on being 
Over all these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly  and though he repeated over and over again the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 the ordinary people in Russia are still a little uncertain as to how communism is really going to work in practice especially in respect of food 
Would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry 
This was something on which K himself seemed to have some doubts  for he kept on threatening that he would pull the ears of those responsible for agricultural production 
And as we know the Virgin Lands are not producing as much as Khrushchev had hoped 
One cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of Khrushchev's agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this Congress  the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the anti party group  Molotov Malenkov Kaganovich and others  including the eighty year old Marshal Voroshilov 
Molotov in particular is being charged with all kinds of sins  especially with wanting to cut down free public services to increase rents and fares  in fact with having been against all the more popular features of the Khrushchev welfare state 
The trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story  what in the secret councils of the Kremlin Molotov had really proposed we just don't know and he has had no chance to reply 
But one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated anti party group would be totally unnecessary if there were not inside the party some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds on the actual methods to be employed in the transition to communism and last but not least on foreign policy 
The whole problem of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition with the capitalist world is in the very center of this Congress 
Mikoyan declared  Molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather the absence of war at a given moment and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war 
His views in fact coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence who look upon it merely as a variant of the cold war or of an armed peace 
One cannot help wondering whether Molotov and the rest of the anti party group are not being used as China's whipping boys by Khrushchev and his faithful followers 
For something clearly has gone very very seriously wrong in Soviet *chinese relations which were never easy and have now deteriorated 
The effect of Chou En lai's clash with Khrushchev together with the everlasting attacks on Molotov & Co  has shifted the whole attention of the world including that of the Soviet people from the epoch making twenty year program to the present Soviet *chinese conflict 
Not only as we know did Chou En lai publicly treat Khrushchev's attack on Albania as something that we cannot consider as a serious Marxist *leninist approach to the problem  i e  as something thoroughly dictatorial and undemocratic  but the Albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to Khrushchev calling him a liar a bully and so on 
It is extremely doubtful that the handful of Albanians who call themselves Communists could have done this without the direct approval of their Chinese friends 
The big question is whether in the name of a restored Chinese *soviet solidarity the Chinese will choose to persuade the Albanians to present their humble apologies to Khrushchev  or get rid of Enver Hoxa 
These seem about the only two ways in which the unhappy incident can now be closed 
But Albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise between China and Russia 
There are other symptoms 
Khrushchev for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism is genuinely favorable to peaceful coexistence and would like above all the Berlin and German problems to be settled peacefully  he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the Russo *american honeymoon of 1959 
But it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere  in the first place from China but perhaps also from that China Lobby which I was assured in Moscow nearly two years ago exists on the quiet inside the party 
To these people solidarity and unity with China should be the real basis of Russia's future policy 
And the Chinese as the Albanian incident shows have strong suspicions that Khrushchev is anxious to secure a shameful peace with the West 
The fact that China  which is obsessed by Formosa  to Khrushchev a very small matter  should be supported by North Korea and North Vietnam is highly indicative 
And one cannot but wonder whether Marshal Malinovsky who was blowing hot and cold exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the West wasn't trying to keep the Chinese quiet 
And this brings us inevitably to the 30 or 50 megaton bomb 
Was not this dropped primarily in order to appease the Chinese  especially after Khrushchev's humiliating surrender to the West in canceling the German peace treaty deadline of December 31 
What does it all add up to 
Indications are that Khrushchev  and with him the bulk of the Soviet people  favor peaceful coexistence and  with the exception of Berlin  the maintenance of the status quo in the world 
The Chinese North Vietnamese and North Koreans on the other hand feel that militarily Russia is strong enough to support them in the just wars of liberation they would like to embark on before long  with China attacking Formosa and the North Koreans and North Vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries 
Perhaps Khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since 1957 when the anti party group nearly liquidated him 
He seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition  but if he is up against China's crusading spirit in world affairs he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life 
He may support China  but he won't   he may break with China  which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous  or he may succeed by all kinds of dangerous concessions in persuading China to be patient 
The next days may show where things stand 
On a misty Sunday morning last month a small band of militant anti *communists called the Minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles east of here 
Eleven men a woman and a teen age boy tramped over cold damp fog enshrouded ground during a two hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare 
To the average American this must sound like an incredible tale from a Saturday night *j movie 
But to the Minutemen this is a serious business 
They feel that the United States is engaged in a life and death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy 
They feel that World War 3 has already begun and they are setting themselves up as a last line of defense against the Communist advance 
Their national leader Robert Bolivar De*pugh of Norborne Mo  says the Minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the Red onslaught 
In their maneuvers last month they wore World War 2 camouflage garb and helmets and carried unloaded *j rifles 
The maneuvers were held in secret after a regional seminar for the Minutemen held in nearby Shiloh Ill  had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs who had arrested regional leader Richard Lauchli of Collinsville Ill  and seized four operative weapons including a Browning machine gun two Browning automatic rifles and an *j rifle 
Undismayed by this contretemps a small band of the faithful gathered at Lauchli's home at 6 30 A *m the next day put on their uniforms and headed for a farm several miles away 
A 60 mm mortar and a 57 mm recoilless rifle owned by Lauchli were brought along 
The mortar was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated 
After a tortuous drive in an open truck and a World War 2 army jeep down soggy trails the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long low ridge and a creek filled gully 
Here the two leaders De*pugh and Lauchli hastened to put the group through its paces 
The Minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment 
They were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge 
They practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades  and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment 
Eleven dummy rounds were fired by Lauchli in a demonstration of rapid fire mortar shooting 
Mrs De*pugh the mother of five children and an active member of her husband's organization participated in all the exercises 
There were no casualties but the guerrillas admitted to being a little tired when the leaders called a halt at 9 A *m to enable out of town members to catch a plane 
Tenure as criterion I would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by Russell Kirk  Dec 16  
It has to do with teachers' salaries and tenure 
Next September after receiving a degree from Yale's Master of Arts in Teaching Program I will be teaching somewhere  that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers 
I will also be underpaid 
The amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers 
Teaching is at present a sellers' market  as a result buyers the public must be satisfied with second rate teachers 
But this is not the real problem  the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality 
Hence all teachers good and bad who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary 
I am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in this country the profession is grossly overpaid 
It follows that teachers as a group cannot expect any marked salary increases  there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance 
The only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them 
The only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure 
Here as in all sectors of the economy quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses 
Loss of initiative on the eve of the great debate on the proposal to give the President broad powers to make across the board tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the Atlantic Community we should face the alternatives on this proposition 
What we will be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate 
Without this power we lay open any American industry which the Europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others 
It is this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs 
A brief for the negative I disagree with Mr Burnham's position on the Common Market  Nov 18  as a desirable organization for us to join 
For him to ignore the political consequences involved in an Atlantic Union of this kind is difficult to understand 
The pressure for our entry to the Common Market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely economic thoroughfare or garden path with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background 
The appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal as well as economic self rule 
In entering this union we will be surrendering most if not all of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the Atlantic Institute  recently set up  or the O *e *c *d  I *m *f and others 
To think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking 
If it is not enough that all of our internationalist One Worlders are advocating that we join this market I refer you to an article in the New York Times' magazine section  Nov 12 1961  by Mr Eric Johnston entitled We Must Join The Common Market 
He says  it has swept aside petty nationalisms age old rivalries and worn out customs 
Referring to Britain he says we see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy placing this authority in Continental hands 
Since the goal of our international planners is a World Government this Atlantic Community would mark a giant step in that direction for once American economic autonomy is absorbed a larger grouping is a question of time 
Frankly it is being very cleverly done for in a sense they have us over a barrel 
Listen to what Mr Johnston has to say  consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict 
We would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need 
We would be crippled by reduced output industrial decline widespread unemployment 
But the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the United States into an Atlantic Community or economic empire but merely what libertarians like Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig Von Mises have been arguing for years  an end to government regulations an end to government competition in industry and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry 
Create a free market here give us a sound debt free money system and we'll compete with anyone Europe and Asia combined 
In short get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won't have to worry about European competition or Communism either 
If we want to preserve our sovereignty this is the way to do it  not acquiesce to an international planning board 
If we go into this Common Market we might just as well stop talking about Constitutional guarantees Connally Amendments or for that matter conservatism in general 
We welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many sided discussion of the Atlantic Common Market which J*n*r will be continuing in our pages

But in spite of this I at present a man 31 years of age and a college professor have been recalled by direction of the President to report on November 25th to Fort Devens Massachusetts for another twelve months of active duty as an *j 4  the equivalent of a *j  
Today seven years after the date of my initial induction as a draftee I am Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Science at St Michael's College 
For after leaving the Army in 1956 I spent five years in graduate school first at Boston College and then at the University of Toronto 
This time added to that which I had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954 makes a total of twenty two  22  years of education 
The possibility of recall into the Army is part of the price that a modern American has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys 
With this no loyal citizen can quarrel 
However it seems axiomatic that the government has an obligation to exercise its mandate reasonably equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably causes 
In my own case I submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking 
Taken back into the Army now as an *j 4 I am leaving 110 college students whose teacher I am 
 a wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from the draft in order to attend my classes 
 at this late date it is impossible for St Michael's College to find a suitable replacement for me 
Even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason  I cannot help looking around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns of every American city and asking myself if our society has gone mad 
Mercenary  term of honor 
In news broadcasts I consistently hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the Katanga Army referred to as mercenaries 
This confuses me no end 
If the Hessian troops sent here willy nilly by the Hessian Government to fight for England in the 1770's were mercenaries what shall we call the *j troops sent to the Congo willy nilly by their governments to fight for the United Nations 
If the *j troops are not mercenaries then the Hessians were not mercenaries either 
And if the foreigners fighting in the Katanga Army are mercenaries then Lafayette and Von Steuben were mercenaries too as were also the members of the Lafayette Escadrille in the early part of World War 1 and of Chennault's Flying Tigers in the early days of World War 2 
Modern postal slogan it doesn't take a Gore Vidal to tell you what's wrong with Cherokee Textile's slogan  Pitney *bowes Objects July 1

The impending death of Pope in the issue of March 5 1960 you had an excellent editorial which said  on trial in Jakarta for having flown for the Indonesian anti *communist insurgents U *s pilot Alan Lawrence Pope boldly told the court that in supporting the freedom fighters he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence of Indonesia 
Facing a prosecution which has demanded the death penalty he said  I have participated in the war against Communism in Korea and at Dienbienphu and I have helped in the evacuation of North Vietnamese to the free world 
I have done all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states which have been threatened by Communist domination 
At least in Indonesia Khrushchev found an American proud to be at total war with Communism ] since then nothing has happened to save the life of Pope 
I found recently a very small article in the New York Times  U *s Flier Loses Plea 
Indonesia Court Upholds Pope's Death Sentence 
Indonesia Military Supreme Court has confirmed the death sentence passed on Alan Lawrence Pope an American pilot 
Pope was convicted last year of having aided North Celebes rebels by flying bombing missions 
He has been in prison since May 1958 when his aircraft was shot down over Moluccas 
He may appeal to President Sukarno for clemency 
As we see Pope may appeal to President Sukarno Khrushchev's friend for clemency 
This possibility is anything but reassuring 
The Eleanor Roosevelt Tractor Committee acts on behalf of the Cuban freedom fighters 
But who will act now and immediately to save the life of Alan Pope 
Are tractors available for him 
Does anybody think of saving the life of an anti *communist American pilot 
An analogy a few days before I saw your mention of what Texas Liberals were doing to promote Louis Capet  The Week June 3  another analogy had occurred to me 
Consider this table  1 
Louis 14  *j 
With no strong men and no parliament to dispute his will he was the government 
2 
Regency  Truman 
A dust settling period of decadence and decline 
3 
Louis 15  Eisenhower 
He opened his mouth said little and thought not at all 
4 
Louis 16  Kennedy 
Not completely virtuous but completely incompetent 
And Marie Antoinette  Jacqueline Bouvier 
The beautiful and light hearted 
5 
French Revolution  conservative Revolution 
Truly that Liberals should choose Louis 14 as a bogey symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic considering the Louis 14 character of their Grand Monarque *j  not only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification  le roi gouverne par lui meme  but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies 
In defeating Louis Capet John Tower's victory in Texas signals once again the end of the divine right of Liberalism 
Confrontation it seems to me that N *c  in his editorial Confrontation  *j Mar 25  has hit upon the real problem that bothers all of us in a complex world  how do we retain our personal relationship with those who suffer 
This affects us all intimately and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress 
I know of no other solution than the one N *c proposes  to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place 
Never have I seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically 
Thank you for the illustrated editorial Confrontation 
It is both great writing and profound religion 
N *c has said something important so well that this preacher will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece 
I feel that N *c hit the very core of our existence in the editorial Confrontation 
Personally it meant a great deal  my only hope is that it will be shared by many many others 
Confrontation should fortify us all whether in Southeast Asia or the U *s 
Congratulations to N *c for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the Peace Corps 
I concur that it is necessary for Americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands 
It would be heartbreaking to see idealism and hence effective leadership thwarted by the poverty and hardship which young Americans will run into 
The editorial Confrontation was certainly direct in its appeal to those of us living here in America 
I personally gained strength from it 
Thanks for continuing to capture the attention and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world 
N *c 's editorial Confrontation is a stunning piece of writing 
I would hope that Sargent Shriver will encourage everyone entering the Peace Corps to read it 
The important people to humanity are not the Khrushchevs and the Castros but the Schweitzers and the Dooleys and the others like them whose names we will never know 
Editor's note  reprints of Confrontation will be included among the material to be distributed to members of the Peace Corps 
A Peace Corps official described the editorial as precisely the message we need to communicate to the men and women who will soon be Peace Corps volunteers 
Improper Bostonian 
F L Lucas's article in *j April 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the New English Bible 
I certainly hope this will be the impression left in the minds of readers rather than the comment by Cleveland Amory in his first of the month column 
It is blind fundamentalist dogmatism to say messing around with the King James version seems to us a perilous sport at best 
Facts in focus Lester Markel is on the right track in his article Interpretation Of Interpretation  *j Mar 11  
The current stereotype of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored fact fancy and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished in this country more than a generation ago 
We don't need this type of protection any more 
The public is now armed with sophistication and numerous competing media 
Besides there are no longer enough corruptible journalists about 
The accepted method of writing news has two major liabilities 
First it does not communicate 
A reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute for instance is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute 
Second it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous 
The charges by the late junior Senator from Wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation 
Yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns 
Despite several years of front page stories the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of Mc*carthy until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way of communicating 
The Senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions 
It seems to me the time has come for the American press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends 
The objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors 
Southern California blackout I would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning President Kennedy's activities so far as Southern California is concerned 
You have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions 
To begin with the all powerful Los Angeles Times does not publish a transcript of these press conferences 
I am sure that they did when Eisenhower was President 
Next because of the time differential the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day 
Up until now the networks have grudgingly run half hour tapes at 5 P *m or sometimes 7 or 10 30 P *m 
Even then a few of the less interesting questions are edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator 
However last night the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got on *j were a few snatches which Douglas Edwards and Huntley and Brinkley could squeeze into their programs 
This is no criticism of them as they obviously cannot get a half hour program into a fifteen minute news summary 
The radio stations did run transcripts  I thought  during the evening hours 
However by comparing the *j snatches two different radio station re runs and the censored Los Angeles Times version I found that the radio stations had edited out questions  A*b*c removed the one regarding Laos  or even a paragraph out of the middle of the President's answer 
I am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country about the abuse he is being subjected to 
We out here don't see enough of the conference to know he is being abused 
I don't know if this is the situation in other parts of the country  apparently it is not 
It also happened with the Inauguration which was not re run at all during the evening hours and I wrote to the *j editor of the Times 
He did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations' not doing this  but nothing happened 
Can you bring the networks' attention to this 
For a college of propaganda I was interested in James Webb Young's Madison Avenue column in which he raised the question  do we Need a college of propaganda 
 *j Feb 11  
In my estimation we definitely do  and the sad part of it is that we had one which was rounding into excellent shape and we let it disintegrate and die 
During the war we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare which included the teaching of propaganda both black and white and the various shades of grey in between 
We had a couple of schools in this country the principal one being on the Marshall Field estate out in Lloyd's Neck 
There were also a couple in Canada and several in England 
The English schools preceded ours and by the time we got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching 
Four of us here in the United States attended first as students then as instructors almost every one of these schools in England Canada and the United States 
We set up the Lloyd's Neck school worked out its curriculum and taught there 
Toward the end of the war we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and how to teach it 
When the end did come and the schools were disbanded and abandoned we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust 
We hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year or so 
Alas no such thing happened 
There apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological warfare 
A study at the Pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there 
And not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way 
Congratulations on the article Do We Need A College Of Propaganda 
This is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this critical field in years and I certainly hope it sparks some action 
Let the media clean house too many of us in public relations were flattered that Richard L Tobin chose to devote his editorial in the March 11 Communications Supplement to the merger of the Public Relations Society of America and the American Public Relations Association 
Snow storm I was surprised and sorry to find in your issue of March 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet been published 
Whether in his forthcoming book C P Snow commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important 
One should be able to get hold of the book at once 
But the attack was made from an advance copy 
If this practice should take root and spread the man who submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post mortem formality 
Editor's note  Sir Robert Watson *watt wrote on page 50 of S*r Research for 4 March 1961  I have read an advance copy of the Snow book which is to be titled Science And Government 
Until the work actually appears I am not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail 
But I have compared its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of Godkin lectures at Harvard from which the book was derived and I can with confidence challenge the gist of C P Snow's incautious tale 
Watson *watt's remarks in S*r did not then constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the Godkin Lectures 
Representatives of Harvard University Press which is publishing the book this month of April recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing Life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in advance of the book's publication date 
The text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt 
Sir Robert Watson *watt's rebuttal of Sir Charles Snow's Godkin Lectures is marred throughout by too forceful a desire to defend Lindemann and apparently himself from Sir Charles' supposed falsehoods while stating those falsehoods in an unclear incoherent argument 
The article presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning 
It calls the conclusion admitted valid by historians and military strategists alike a perverted conclusion 
Nonsense 
It submits an enthusiastic impressionistic conception of Lindemann contributing another aspect of the man but on no more authoritative basis than Sir Charles' account 
We are left to choose between the two Lindemanns 
The only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party 
But we are to believe that Lindemann actively supported radar outside the Tizard Committee and dissembling discounted it inside 
If so I would lean to Sir Charles' conception of the man 
I think it was a grave error to print the article at this time 
To the unfortunate people unable to attend the Godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from reading it 
It is not news that Nathan Milstein is a wizard of the violin 
Certainly not in Orchestra Hall where he has played countless recitals and where Thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra playing the Brahms Concerto with his own slashing demon ridden cadenza melting into the high pale pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music or forever finds it closed 
There was about that song something incandescent for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat 
Not the noblest performance we have heard him play or the most spacious or even the most eloquent 
Those would be reserved for the orchestra's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself 
This time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood 
But he had in Walter Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point 
That is when Mr Milstein thrust straight to the core of the music sparks flying bow shredding violin singing glittering and sometimes spitting Mr Hendl could go along 
But Mr Hendl does not go straight to any point 
He flounders and lets music sprawl 
There was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist orchestra and music to ultimate fusion 
So we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein but not great Brahms 
The concert opened with another big romantic score Schumann's Overture to Manfred which suffered fate this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point to keep it afloat 
Hindemith's joust with Weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune for it demands transluscent textures buoyant rhythms and astringent wit 
It got the kind of scrambled coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style 
Bayreuth next summer the Bayreuth Festival opens July 23 with a new production of Tannhaeuser staged by Wieland Wagner who is doing all the operas this time and conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch

Remember how by a series of booking absurdities Chicago missed seeing the Bolshoi Ballet 
Remember how by lack of two big theaters Chicago missed the first visit of the Royal Danish Ballet 
Well now we have two big theaters 
But barring a miracle and don't hold your breath for it Chicago will not see the Leningrad *kirov Ballet which stems from the ballet cradle of the Maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world 
Before you let loose a howl saying we announced its coming not once but several times indeed we did 
The engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in Mc*cormick Place which Sol Hurok ballet booker extraordinary considers the finest house of its kind in the country  and of course he doesn't weep at the capacity either 
It was all set 
Allied Arts Corporation first listed the Chicago dates as Dec 4 thru 10 
Later the Hurok office made it Dec 8 thru 17 a nice long booking for the full repertory 
But if you keep a calendar of events as we do you noticed a conflict 
Allied Arts had booked Marlene Dietrich into Mc*cormick Place Dec 8 and 9 
Something had to give 
Not La Dietrich 
Allied Arts then notified us that the Kirov would cut short its Los Angeles booking fly here to open Nov 28 and close Dec 2 
Shorter booking but still a booking 
We printed it 
A couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned Allied Arts for ticket information and was told the newspapers had made a mistake 
So I started making some calls of my own 
These are the results 
The Kirov Ballet is firmly booked into the Shrine Auditorium Los Angeles Nov 21 thru Dec 4 
Not a chance of opening here Nov 28  barring that miracle 
Then why not the juicy booking Hurok had held for us 
Well Dietrich won't budge from Mc*cormick Place 
Then how about the Civic Opera House 
Well Allied Arts has booked Lena Horne there for a week starting Dec 4 
Queried about the impasse Allied Arts said  better cancel the Kirov for the time being 
It's all up in the air again 
So the Kirov will fly back to Russia minus a Chicago engagement a serious loss for dance fans  and for the frustrated bookers cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country 
Will somebody please reopen the Auditorium

H E Bates has scribbled a farce called Hark Hark The Lark ] it is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season 
If there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans it is hard to find 
Perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in England still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics 
Anyway a number of them meet here in devastating collisions 
One is an imperial London stockbroker called Jerebohm 
Another is a wily countryman called Larkin whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled I believe in earlier volumes of Mr Bates' comedie humaine 
What's up now 
Well Jerebohm and his wife Pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities 
They want to own a junior grade castle or a manor house or some modest little place where Shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for Great Elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers 
They are willing to settle however in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at 
And of course Larkin has just the thing they want 
Splendor by sorcery it's a horror 
The name of it is Gore Court and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress T S Eliot 
That's not precisely the way Larkin urges them to look at it though 
He conjures herds of deer and wild birds crowding the air 
He suggests that Gore Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor 
The stained glass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform 
The vast dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch 
Larkin has an answer to all that 
The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas for example will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers cooks and maids 
Also perhaps table tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented 
It's a wonder really to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse 
He doesn't really need the immense sum of money  probably converted from American gold on the London Exchange  he makes them pay 
For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot 
He has a glorious wife and many children 
When he needs money to buy something like say the Rolls *royce he keeps near his vegetable patch he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies 
One of those capital gains ventures in fact has saddled him with Gore Court 
He is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands 
And the Jerebohms are more than willing to buy it 
They plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox's life on earth 
First one then the other if in Larkin's eyes they are nothing but Piccadilly farmers he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living 
Mr Bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc 
Oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war 
First the Larkins are ahead then the Jerebohms 
After Larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers 
One of the local callers a retired brigadier apparently left over from Kipling's tales of India does not approve of the way Larkin gets his birds 
He doesn't think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting 
But the brigadier dines on the birds with relish 
It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel De Cervantes' Don Quixote is the brilliant Russian spectacle done in wide screen and color which opened yesterday at the Fifty fifth Street and Sixty eighth Street Playhouses 
More than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi comic knight errant and his squire Sancho Panza in seventeenth century Spain this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character 
Nikolai Cherkasov the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible performs the lanky Don Quixote and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man 
His addle brained knight errant self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight errantry had become a joke is as Cervantes no doubt intended a gaunt but gracious symbol of good moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics hypocrites and rogues 
Cherkasov does not caricature him as some actors have been inclined to do 
He treats this deep eyed bearded bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect 
Directed by Grigory Kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world 
The complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the Russian dialogue 
The voices of all the characters including that of Cherkasov have richness roughness or color to conform with the personalities 
And the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed 
Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish there is no violation of artistry or logic here 
Splendid too is the performance of Yuri Tolubeyev one of Russia's leading comedians as Sancho Panza the fat grotesque squire 
Though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don he gives it a firmness and toughness  a sort of peasant dignity  too 
It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons 
The episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an island is one of the best in the film 
True the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half before Don Quixote goes to the duke's court 
But strength and poignancy develop thenceforth and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy 
There are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange 
Also on the bill at the Fifty fifth Street is a nice ten minute color film called Sunday In Greenwich Village a tour of the haunts and joints 
Television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family 
There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago style jazz in prime evening time for example could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary 
At least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for Chicago And All That Jazz presented on *j Nov 26 
The program came out of the *j Special Projects department and was slotted in the Du Pont Show Of The Week series 
Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines 
If so it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department  one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents 
As a matter of fact this latter approach has already been tried and with pleasing results 
A few years ago a Timex All *star Jazz Show offered a broad range of styles ranging from Lionel Hampton's big band to the free wheeling Dukes Of Dixieland 
An enthusiastic audience confirmed the live character of the hour and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance 
About that same time John Crosby's *j series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do 
In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods 
The program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music 
Cameras stared at soloists' faces in extreme closeups then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work 
Chicago And All That Jazz could not be faulted on the choice of artists 
Some of the in person performers were Jack Teagarden Gene Krupa Bud Freeman Pee Wee Russell Johnny St Cyr Joe Sullivan Red Allen Lil Armstrong Blossom Seeley 
The jazz buff could hardly ask for more 
Furthermore Garry Moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies 
 he played host at the Timex show already mentioned 
 one of the script's big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today 
N*b*c had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share 
For example there was sheet music with the word jazz in the title to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold 
Samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession like telephone poles passing on the highway while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920's 
However well chosen and cleverly arranged such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening's main business which  considering the talent at hand  should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style 
Another source of *j pride was its rare film clip of Bix Beiderbecke but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse 
Similarly in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups the program allowed no time for a close perusal 
Chicago And All That Jazz may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer 
By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today's artists the program turned out to be a not quite perfect example of either 
Still the network's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended and future essays happily anticipated 
Even Joan Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti's Lucia Di Lammermoor Sunday night 
The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as Miss Sutherland took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic Mad Scene created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers 
Her entrance in Scene 2 Act 1 brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note 
Thereafter the audience waxed applause happy but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization 
As she gained composure during the second act her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of Lucia 
She topped the sextet brilliantly 
Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the Mad Scene but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment 
Miss Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene  a much more girlish Lucia a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing and an actress immersed in her role 
What followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as Miss Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today 
This big flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined 
Nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene or she may warm up slowly 
In the fullness of her vocal splendor however she could sing the famous scene magnificently 
Technically it was fascinating aurally spell binding and dramatically quite realistic 
Many years have passed since a Metropolitan audience heard anything comparable 
Her debut over perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine 
The performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor Silvio Varviso 
He injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years 
He may respect too much the Italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes but to restrain them in a singers' opera may be quite difficult 
Richard Tucker sang Edgardo in glorious voice 
His bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction 
The remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable 
Miss Sutherland first sang Lucia at Covent Garden in 1959 
 the first Metropolitan Opera broadcast on Dec 9 will introduce her as Lucia 
 she has since turned to Bellini whose opera Beatrice Di Tenda in a concert version with the American Opera Society introduced her to New York last season 
She will sing La Sonambula with it here next week 
Anyone for musical Ping pong 
It's really quite fun  as long as you like games 
You will need a stereo music system with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart and one or more of the new London Phase 4 records 
There are 12 of these to choose from all of them of popular music except for the star release Pass In Review  S*p 44001  
This features the marching songs of several nations recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand 
Complete with crowd effects interruptions by jet planes and sundry other touches of realism this disc displays London's new technique to the best effect 
All of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program 
No reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music 
Directionality is greatly exaggerated most of the time  but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix there is excellent depth and dimension to the music 
You definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back 
This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound 
London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels 
These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record 
In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects 
Some clue to the character of London's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word percussion or percussive 
Drums xylophones castanets and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well 
Only too often however you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right 
They are definitely in the same room with you but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley 
The Percussive Twenties  S*p 44006  stirs pleasant memories with well known songs of that day and Johnny Keating's Kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in Percussive Moods  S*p 44005  
Big Band Percussion  S*p 44002  seemed one of the least attractive discs  the arrangements just didn't have so much character as the others 
There is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies 
The penalty for this is noticeable in the big bold brilliant but brassy piano sounds in Melody And Percussion For Two Pianos  S*p 44007  
All of the releases however are recorded at a gratifyingly high level with resultant masking of any surface noise 
Pass In Review practically guarantees enjoyment and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system 
Many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic but not realistic 
Strange but true  authenticity and realism often aren't related at all 
Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic  in fact impeccably so 
In any given period piece the costumes bric a brac vehicles and decor bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity 
The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter 
During the making recently of an important Biblical film some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors but of architectural developments sports arenas vehicles and other paraphernalia were compiled consulted and complied with 
But alas the authenticity seems to stop at the set's edge 
The drama itself  and this seems to be lavishly true of Biblical drama  often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all 
The storyline in sort is wildly unrealistic 
Thus in The Story Of Ruth we have Ruth Naomi and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic 
But except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline  i e  that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound up with Boaz  the film version has little to do with the Bible 
And in the new King Of Kings the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the Gospels 
Earlier this month Edward R Murrow director of the United States Information Agency came to Hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry 
He talked about unauthentic storylines too 
He intimated that they weren't doing the country much good in the Cold War 
And to an industry that prides itself on authenticity he urged greater realism 
In many corners of the globe he said the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet 
Would we want a future day Gibbon or Macaulay recounting the saga of America with movies as his prime source of knowledge 
Yet for much of the globe Hollywood is just that  prime if not sole source of knowledge 
If a man totally ignorant of America were to judge our land and its civilization based on Hollywood alone what conclusions do you think he might come to 
Francois D'*albert Hungarian born violinist who made his New York debut three years ago played a return engagement last night in Judson Hall 
He is now president of the Chicago Conservatory College 
His pianist was Donald Jenni a faculty member at De*paul University 
The acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists so that for the first half of the program when the piano was partially open Mr Jenni's playing was too loud 
In vying with him Mr D'*albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone 
This was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances however except in the case of the opening work Mozart's Sonata in *j  K 526  which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion 
Brahm's Sonata in *j although also vigorous stood up well under the two artists' strong large scale treatment 
Mr D'*albert has a firm attractive tone which eschews an overly sweet vibrato 
He made the most of the long Brahmsian phrases and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance 
A Sonata For Violin And Piano called Bella Bella by Robert Fleming was given its first United States performance 
The title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer who is also a member of the National Film Board of Canada 
The work's two movements one melodically sentimental the other brightly capricious are clever enough in a Ravel like style but they rehash a wornout idiom 
They might well indicate conjugal felicity but in musical terms that smack of Hollywood 
Works by Dohnanyi Hubay Mr D'*albert himself and Paganini indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase 
Standard items by Sarasate and Saint *saens completed the program 
In recent years Anna Xydis has played with the New York Philharmonic and at Lewisohn Stadium but her program last night at Town Hall was the Greek born pianist's first New York recital since 1948 
Miss Xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control 
And the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound 
Since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition Miss Xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure 
She played with style and a touch of the grand manner and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures 
The second half of her program was devoted to Russian composers of this century 
It was in them that Miss Xydis was at her best 
The Rachmaninoff Prelude No 12 Op 32 for instance gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities  the ability to produce fine deep sounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble 
The four Kabalevsky Preludes were also assured rich in color and songful 
And the Prokofieff Seventh Sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that Prokofieff needs 
Miss Xydis' earlier selections were Mendelssohn's Variations Serieuses in which each variation was nicely set off from the others  Haydn's Sonata in *j minor which was unfailingly pleasant in sound and Chopin's Sonata in *j flat minor 
A memory lapse in the last somewhat marred the pianist's performance 
So what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing 
Miss Xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing 
All the generals who held important commands in World War 2 did not write books 
It only seems as if they did 
And the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written 
One of the very best is only now published in this country five years after its first publication in England 
It is Defeat Into Victory by Field Marshal Viscount Slim 
A long book heavily weighted with military technicalities in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally 
Field Marshal Slim has abridged it for the benefit of those who finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter moves are more interested in men and their reactions to stress hardship and danger 
The man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is of course the Field Marshal himself 
William Joseph Slim First Viscount Slim former Governor General of Australia was the principal British commander in the field during the Burma War 
He had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the ill prepared ill equipped British forces were outmaneuvered outfought and outgeneraled 
He returned in command of an international army of Gurkhas Indians Africans Chinese and British 
And in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of Burma he waged one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war 
The Forgotten War his soldiers called the Burma fighting because the war in Africa and Europe enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines 
Parts of Defeat Into Victory are a tangle of Burmese place names and military units but a little application makes everything clear enough 
On the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well written book 
Field Marshal Slim is striking in description amusing in many anecdotes 
He has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even a cardinal error 
He praises many individuals generously 
He himself seems to be tough tireless able and intelligent more intellectual and self critical than most soldiers 
Remaking an army to win Defeat Into Victory is a dramatic and lively military narrative 
But it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command of decisions and their reasons of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action 
Before he could return to Burma Field Marshal Slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits 
His remarks about training discipline morale leadership and command are enlightening 
He believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many 
He believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there 
For general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly 
Other crucial matters required constant supervision  labor and all noncombatant troops whose morale was vital too  administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with Top Brass  British American and Chinese  health hygiene medical aid and preventive medicine  hospitals  inadequate  and nurses  scanty   food and military supplies  logistics and transport  airdrops and airstrips  roads and river barges to be built 
Expected of a commander commenting on these and other matters Field Marshal Slim makes many frank and provocative remarks  when in doubt as to two courses of action a general should choose the bolder 
The commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory  for that is his duty 
It only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you cannot give them 
It depresses them 
So I made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of it 
Field Marshal Slim is more impressed by the courage of Japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders 
Of the Japanese private he says  he fought and marched till he died 
If 500 Japanese were ordered to hold a position we had to kill 495 before it was ours  and then the last five killed themselves 
Brooding about future wars the Field Marshal has this to say  the Asian fighting man is at least equally brave  as the white  usually more careless of death less encumbered by mental doubts less troubled by humanitarian sentiment and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him 
He is by background and living standards better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources 
A bunch of young buckaroos from out West who go by the name of Texas Boys Choir loped into Town Hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience 
Actually the program they sang was at least two thirds serious and high minded and they sang it beautifully 
Under the capable direction of the choir's founder Geroge Bragg the twenty six boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of Renaissance and Baroque madrigals and motets excerpts from Pergolesi's Stabat Mater and all of the Britten Ceremonial Of Carols 
Their singing was well balanced clear and within obvious limitations extremely pleasing 
The limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices  an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity an occasional waver and now and then a bleat 
But Mr Bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior 
Most surprising of all he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words 
The Latin for example was not only clear  it was even beautiful 
Furthermore there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music 
Lines came out neatly and in good balance 
Tempos were lively 
The piano accompaniments by Istvan Szelenyi were stylish 
A boy soprano named Dixon Boyd sang a Durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly 
Other capable soloists included David Clifton Joseph Schockler and Pat Thompson 
The final group included folk songs from back home stomped out shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume 
Boys will be boys and Texans will be Texans 
The combination proved quite irresistible last night 
The Polish song and dance company called Mazowsze after the region of Poland where it has its headquarters opened a three week engagement at the City Center last night 
A thoroughly ingratiating company it is and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening 
Not that it is all funny by any means though some of it is definitely so but simply that the dancers are young and handsome high spirited and communicative and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied 
There is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title for it has a kind of nonstop format and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification 
The material is all basically of folk origin gleaned from every section of Poland 
But under the direction of Mira Ziminska *sygietynska who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948 it has all been put into theatrical form treated selectively choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators and performed altogether professionally 
Under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training and an equally professional sense of performing 
Since the organization was created thirteen years ago it is obvious that this is not the original company  it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company 
The girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters 
The stage is constantly full of them  indeed there are never fewer than eight of them on stage and that is only for the more intimate numbers 
They can be exuberant or sentimental flirtatious or funny but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull 
To pick out particular numbers is something of a problem but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed 
There is for example a stunning Krakowiak that closes the first act  the mazurka choreographed by Witold Zapala to music from Moniuszko's opera Strasny Dwor' may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see  there is an enchanting polonaise  and the dances and songs from the Tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men 
Everywhere there are little touches of humor and the leader of the on stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth 
The Theatre by the *sea Matunuck presents King Of Hearts by Jean Kerr and Eleanor Brooke 
Directed by Michael Murray  settings by William David Roberts 
The cast  producer John Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season's opener at Matunuck in Jean Kerr's King Of Hearts 
The dialogue is sharp witty and candid  typical don't eat the daisies material  which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays and it was obvious that the Theatre by the *sea audience liked it 
The story is of a famous strip cartoonist an arty individual whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts a 10 year old to provide him with fresh idea material 
This is when his troubles begin not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires and who turns out to have ideas of his own with particular respect to the hero's sweetheart secretary 
John Heffernan playing Larry Larkin the cartoonist carries the show in marvelous fashion 
His portrayal of an edgy head in the clouds artist is virtually flawless 
This may be unfortunate perhaps from the standpoint of David Hedison Providence's contribution to Hollywood who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th Century *fox 
Not that Mr Hedison does not make the most of his role 
He does and more 
But the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist and it has to be that way 
A word should be said for Gary Morgan a Broadway youngster who as the adopted son makes life miserable for nearly everybody and Larkin in particular 
And for his playmate Francis Coletta of West Warwick who has a bit part Billy 
On the whole audiences will like this performance 
It is a tremendous book lively constantly moving and the Matunuck cast does well by it 
The Newport Playhouse presents Epitaph For George Dillon by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton directed by Wallace Gray 
The cast  the angriest young man in Newport last night was at the Playhouse where Epitaph For George Dillon opened as the jazz festival closed 
For the hero of this work by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session 
He's mad at a world he did not make 
Furthermore he's something of a scoundrel an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger tips 
This is in contrast to the family with whom he boards 
They not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well 
It is into this household one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people that George Dillon enters at the beginning of the play 
An unsuccessful playwright and actor he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists 
By the end of the third act the artist is dead but the body lingers on a shell among other shells 
Not altogether a successful play Epitaph For George Dillon overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling 
It is awfully talky for instance and not all of the talk is terribly impressive 
But it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten 
There is a fine second act as an example one in which Samuel Groom as Dillon has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another 
This is an exciting young actor to watch 
Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura Stuart whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch 
Miss Stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment 
Also fine are Sue Lawless as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive Harold Cherry as her scratchy spouse and Hildy Weissman as a vegetable in human form 
Wallace Gray has directed a difficult play here usually well but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste 
Still his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance despair 
The Warwick Musical Theater presents Where's Charley 
With music and lyrics by Frank Loesser directed by Christopher Hewett choreography by Peter Conlow musical direction by Samuel Matlowsky 
The cast  everybody fell in love with Amy again last night at the Warwick Musical Theater and Shelley Berman was to blame 
One of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented Once In Love With Amy is also of course one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of American musical comedy in our era 
So the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after Act 2 got a rousing opening chorus Where's Charley 
 and Berman sifted out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being 
It is greatly to Berman's credit that he made no attempt to outdo Ray Bolger 
He dropped his earlier and delightful hamming which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called Charley's Aunt and let himself go with as appealing an Amy as anybody could ask 
In brief Berman played himself and not Bolger 
The big audience started applauding even before he had finished 
The whole production this week is fresh and lively 
The costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the Gibson Girl days 
The ballet work is on the nose especially in the opening number by The New Ashmolean Marching Society and Students' Conservatory Band along with a fiery and sultry Brazilian fantasia later 
Berman whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist proved himself very much at home in musical comedy 
Sparrow size Virginia Gibson with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile made a suitably perky Amy while Melisande Congdon as the real aunt was positively monumental in the very best Gibson Girl manner 
All told Where's Charley 
Ought not to be missed 
It has a fast pace excellent music expert direction and not only a good comedian but an appealing person in his own right Mr Berman 
The Broadway Theater League of Rhode Island presents C Edwin Knill's and Martin Tahse's production of Fiorello ] at Veterans Memorial Auditorium 
The book is by Jerome Weidman and George Abbott music by Jerry Bock lyrics by Sheldon Harnick choreography by Peter Gennaro scenery costumes and lighting by William and Jean Eckart musical direction by Jack Elliott and the production was directed by Mr Abbott 
The cast  this is one of the happier events of the season 
The company which performed the Pulitzer Prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce the politicians are in fine voice the chorines evoke happy memories and the Little Flower rides to break a lance again 
I saw Fiorello ] performed in New York by the original cast and I think this company is every bit as good and perhaps better 
Certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking 
Bob Carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to La*guardia as Tom Bosley does but I was amazed at the way he became more and more Fiorello as the evening progressed until one had to catch one's self up and remember that this wasn't really La*guardia come back among us again 
Then Rudy Bond was simply grand as Ben the distraught Republican Party district chieftain 
And Paul Lipson as Morris the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley's dinner was fine too 
As for the ladies they were full of charm and sincerity and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving honest little man 
Charlotte Fairchild was excellent as the loyal Marie who became the second Mrs La*guardia singing and acting with remarkable conviction 
Jen Nelson as Thea his first wife managed to make that short role impressive 
And little Zeme North a Dora with real spirit and verve was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for Floyd the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings 
Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of On The Side Of The Angels and Politics And Poker were handled splendidly and I thought Rudy Bond and his band of tuneful ward heelers made Little Tin Box even better than it was done by the New York cast  all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity 
The party at Floyd's penthouse gave the chorines a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era's nonsense 
La*guardia's multi lingual rallies when he is running for Congress are well staged and wind up in a wild Jewish folk dance that is really great musical theater 
Martin Tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions 
Not a corner has been visibly cut in this one 
The sets are remarkably elaborate for a road show that doesn't pause long in any one place and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness 
 several times recently I have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes 
I'm glad to say there's none of that distraction in this Fiorello ]  it has all been done in superb style and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater 
Loew's theater presents Where The Boys Are an *j picture produced by Joe Pasternak and directed by Henry Levin from a screenplay by George Wells 
The cast  since the hero a sterling and upright fellow is a rich Brown senior while two Yalies are cast as virtual rapists I suppose I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on Where The Boys Are but I shall do nothing of the sort 
Instead  and not just to prove my objectivity  I hasten to report that it's a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the Easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in Fort Lauderdale and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group  that is to say sex 
The answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual 
If most of them weren't exactly specific  well that's the way it is in life I guess 
But at least it's reassuring to see some teenagers who don't profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead 
Where The Boys Are also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy 
There are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations  the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a mermaid is performing 
Most of the female faces are new or at least not too familiar 
Dolores Hart is charming in a leading role and quite believable 
I was delighted with Paula Prentiss' comedy performance which was as fresh and unstilted as one's highest hopes might ask 
A couple of the males made good comedy too  Jim Hutton and Frank Gorshin 
The only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette Mimieux but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases I suppose this was the attitude the part called for 
I must say however that I preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it 
To anyone who remembers Newport at its less than maximum violence this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz Festival ought to prove entertaining 
The second feature The Price Of Silence is a British detective story that will talk your head off 
The superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of William James was never more evident than in his letters 
Here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking 
To both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest the same open minded relish for what was unique in each the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence the same gallantry of judgment 
For this latest addition to the Great Letters Series under the general editorship of Louis Kronenberger Miss Hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of James's genius not to mention the felicities of his style 
And how he could write ] his famous criticism of brother Henry's third style is surely as subtly even elegantly worded an analysis of the latter's intricate air castles as Henry himself could ever have produced 
His letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant forthright and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown up penned to a sensitive child and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor 
Most of all his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help to explain Whitehead's reference to James as that adorable genius 
Miss Hardwick speaks of his superb gift for intellectual friendship and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism 
This is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication  or even desire for communication  between differing schools of thought 
It holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word intellectual has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues 
To his Harvard colleague Josiah Royce whose philosophic position differed radically from his own James could write different as our minds are yours has nourished mine as no other social influence ever has and in converse with you I have always felt that my life was being lived importantly 
Of another colleague George Santayana he could write  the great event in my life recently has been the reading of Santayana's book 
Although I absolutely reject the Platonism of it I have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page 
Writing to his colleague George Herbert Palmer  glorious old Palmer as he addresses him  James says that if only the students at Harvard could really understand Royce Santayana Palmer and himself and see that their varying systems are so many religions ways of fronting life and worth fighting for then Harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe 
The best condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems 
The world might ring with the struggle if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other 
The belaboring is of course jocular yet James was not lacking in fundamental seriousness  unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of God 
To James this vision never quite came despite his appreciation of it in others 
But there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent  you ask what I am going to reply to Bradley 
But why need one reply to everything and everybody 
I think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations 
All polemic of ours should I believe be either very broad statements of contrast or fine points treated singly and as far as possible impersonally 
As far as the rising generation goes why not simply express ourselves positively and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other 
Here again God will know his own 
The collected works of James Thurber now numbering 25 volumes  including the present exhibit  represent a high standard of literary excellence as every schoolboy knows 
The primitive eclogue quality of his drawings akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall is equally well known 
About all that remains to be said is that the present selection most of which appeared first in The New Yorker comprises  as usual  a slightly unstrung necklace held together by little more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book 
The one unifying note if any is sounded in the initial article entitled  How To Get Through The Day 
It is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word games for insomniacs the hospitalized and others forced to rely on inner resources including  in the *j alone  palindromes paraphrases and parodies 
The Tyranny Of Trivia suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber 
And new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled  Friends Romans Countrymen Lend Me Your Ear *muffs such a phrase as Drifts Through Dream and The New Vocabularianism 
Some of Thurber's curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor malapropism and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in extreme cases 
A burlesque paean entitled  Hark The Herald Tribune Times And All The Other Angels Sing brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion picture ballyhooey 
How The Kooks Crumble features an amusingly accurate take off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio *t*v commercials and The Watchers Of The Night is a veritable waking nightmare 
A semi serious literary document entitled The Wings Of Henry James is noteworthy if only for a keenly trenchant though little known comment on the master's difficult later period by modest Owen Wister author of The Virginian 
James he remarks in a letter to a friend is attempting the impossible namely to produce upon the reader as a painting produces upon the gazer a number of superimposed simultaneous impressions 
He would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once and get all at once the various shadings and complexities 
Equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation  so much has already been written about everything that you can't find out anything about it 
Or the mildly epigrammatic utterance  also a quotation   woman's place is in the wrong 
Who but Thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences 
A tribute to midsummer bang sashes seems terribly funny though it would be hard to explain why 
One of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in July and I leaped out of sleep and out of bed 
It's just a bat said my wife reassuringly and I sighed with relief 
Thank God for that I said  I thought it was a human being 
In a sense perhaps Thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter  was it Salvador Dali 
 who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the abdomen 
That is it is literally a picture window  you don't see into the viscera  you see a picture  trees or flowers 
This is something like what Thurber's best effects are like if I am not mistaken 
Though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic pen and ink sketches  several old favorites are scattered through the present volume  Thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple unaffected humanness 
In his concluding paragraph he writes  the devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can 
For many readers Thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight 
The latest Low is a puzzler 
The master's hand has lost none of its craft 
He is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties 
The reader meets a few old friends like Blimp and the *j horse and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race her hair standing straight out 
But there is a difference between the present volume and the early Low 
There is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show 
But there was terror in the thirties when the Nazis were on the loose and in those days Low struck like lightning 
Anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference 
It might be argued that the Communists are less inhuman than the Nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key 
But this argument cannot be pushed very far because the Communist system makes up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect to corrosion 
The Communists wield a power unknown to Hitler 
And the leading issue that of piecemeal aggression remains the same 
This is drama enough 
Do we ourselves offer Mr Low less of a crusade 
In the thirties we would not face our enemy  that was a nightmarish situation and Low was in his element 
Now we have stood up to the Communists  we are stronger and more self confident  and Low cannot so easily put us to rights 
Or does the reason for less Jovian drawings lie elsewhere 
It might be that Low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now 
He writes Confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views  only up to lunchtime 
Whatever the cause his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic 
Dulles 
He does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man 
Mc*carthy 
The skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath 
Suez 
Low seems to have supported Eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently so there is no fire in his eye 
Stalin's death Churchill's farewell to public life Hillary and Tensing on Everest Quemoy and Matsu  all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade 
Instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles 
Their Eisenhower is insubstantial 
Did Low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections 
He often drew the bomb 
He showed puny men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines 
And Khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all 
But but and but 
Look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale 
Read the moderately brief text not for captions sometimes for tart epigrams once in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas 
A gray fox with a patch on one eye  confidence man city slicker lebensraum specialist  tries to take over Catfish Bend in this third relaxed allegory from Mr Burman's refreshing Louisiana animal community 
The fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from New Orleans accompanied by one wharf rat 
But like all despots as he builds his following from among the gullible he grows more threatening toward those who won't follow  such solid citizens as Doc Raccoon  Judge Black the vegetarian black snake  and the eagle who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in Washington posing for fifty cent pieces 
As soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats who of course say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city 
 the followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others 
 they train the mink and other animals to fight 
And pretty soon gray fox is announcing that he won't have anyone around that's against him and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds 
Robert Hillyer the poet writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that Mr Burman ought to win a Nobel Prize for the Catfish Bend series 
He may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes 
But it's hard to imagine Mr Burman as a Nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables 
In substance they lie somewhere between the Southern dialect animal stories of Joel Chandler Harris  Uncle Remus  and the polished witty fables of James Thurber 
George Kennan's account of relations between Russia and the West from the fall of Tsarism to the end of World War 2 is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years 
It combines qualities that are seldom found in one work  scrupulous scholarship a fund of personal experience a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era's great historical issues 
In short the book based largely on lectures delivered at Harvard University is both reliable and readable  the author possesses an uncommonly fine English style and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time 
If Mr Kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals if his analysis of how Western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic  well the record itself is not too encouraging 
Mr Kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken 
But he rejects perhaps a little too sweepingly the theory that disloyal and pro *communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing Stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 
After all Alger Hiss subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret State Department documents to Soviet agents was at Yalta 
And Harry Dexter White implicated in F *b *i reports in Communist associations was one of the architects of the Morgenthau Plan which had it ever been put into full operation would have simply handed Germany to Stalin 
One item in this unhappy scheme was to have Germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors among whom only the Soviet Union possessed real military strength 
It is quite probable however that stupidity inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like unconditional surrender had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with Communism 
Mr Kennan sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way  dashed hope you see first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills the unshakeable American commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender  the tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemy's power no matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future 
Recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with Hitler he points out the shocking failure to give support to the anti *nazi underground which very nearly eliminated Hitler in 1944 
A veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of Russian language history and literature Kennan recalls how at the time of Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 he penned a private note to a State Department official expressing the hope that never would we associate ourselves with Russian purposes in the areas of eastern Europe beyond her own boundaries 
The hope was vain 
With justified bitterness the author speaks of what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the Russian Communist movement about the history of its diplomacy about what had happened in the purges and about what had been going on in Poland and the Baltic States 
He also speaks of Franklin D Roosevelt's puerile assumption that if only he  Stalin  could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like F *d *r himself ideological preconceptions would melt and Russia's co operation with the West could be easily arranged 
No wonder Khrushchev's first message to President Kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the good old days of Roosevelt 
This fascinating story begins with a sketch rich in personal detail of the glancing mutual impact of World War 1 and the two instalments of the Russian Revolution 
The first of these involved the replacement of the Tsar by a liberal Provisional Government in March 1917  the second the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks  who later called themselves Communists  in November of the same year 
As Kennan shows the judgment of the Allied governments about what was happening in Russia was warped by the obsession of defeating Germany 
They were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the Russian people fighting 
They attributed everything that went wrong in Russia to German influence and intrigue 
This more than any other factor led to the fiasco of Allied intervention 
As the author very justly says  had a world war not been in progress there would never under any conceivable stretch of the imagination have been an Allied intervention in North Russia 
The scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by Communist propaganda  here Kennan operating with precise facts and figures performs an excellent job of debunking 
Plebian dictators of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's vivid style the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected 
On Stalin  this was a man of incredible criminality of a criminality effectively without limits  a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love without mercy or pity  a man in whose entourage none was ever safe  a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment  a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime 
And here is Kennan's image of Hitler Stalin's temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples and his later enemy  behind that Charlie Chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead behind the tirades and the sulky silences the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare behind the prejudices the cynicism the total amorality of behavior behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes there lay a statesman of no mean qualities  shrewd calculating in many ways realistic endowed  like Stalin  with considerable powers of dissimulation capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired yet bold and resolute in his decisions and possessing one gift Stalin did not possess  the ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word 
Two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges  there is no mention of the Potsdam Conference or the Morgenthau Plan 
And in a concluding chapter about America's stance in the contemporary world one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time  how to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war 
But one should not ask for everything 
Mr Kennan who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed American ambassador to Yugoslavia is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future 
The story of a quarter of a century of Soviet *western relations is vitally important and it is told with the fire of a first rate historical narrator 
The Ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic unrest lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm 
In Donnybrook there is quite a different Eire a rural land where singing dancing fist fighting and romancing are the thing 
There is plenty of violence to be sure but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed 
By and large Robert Mc*enroe's adaptation of Maurice Walsh's film The Quiet Man provides the entertainment it set out to and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one 
This is the tale of one John Enright an American who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man 
But Innesfree where Ellen Roe Danaher and her bullying brother Will live is no place for a man who will not use his fists 
So Enright's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded considerably thereby providing the tale which is told 
You may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word Donnybrook means 
Then there is a matchmaker one Mikeen Flynn a role for which Eddie Foy was happily selected 
Now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in Ireland should happen also to be a talented soft shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs torso and neck except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play 
Mr Foy is a joy having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect 
His matchmaking is naturally incidental and it only serves Flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony 
Art Lund a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice impersonates Enright 
Although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique that's not what an ex prize fighter is supposed to have anyway 
Joan Fagan a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not plays Ellen and sings the role very well too 
If the mettle which Ellen exhibits has a bit of theatrical dross in it never mind  she fits into the general scheme well enough 
Susan Johnson as the widow spends the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one 
She has a good firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening 
Then there are a pair of old biddies played by Grace Carney and Sibly Bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock Irish characters but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that they're quite entertaining 
And in the role of Will Danaher Philip Bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not only one American but the whole British army if he chose 
Donnybrook is no Brigadoon but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing 
The ballads are sweet and sad and the music generally competent 
It sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain and some of it such as the catchy Sez I does 
A Toast To The Bride sung by Clarence Nordstrom playing a character called Old Man Toomey is quite simple direct and touching 
The men of Innesfree are got up authentically in cloth caps and sweaters and their dancing and singing is fine 
So is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under Jack Cole's expert choreographic direction 
The male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating 
Rouben Ter *arutunian in his stage settings often uses the scrim curtain behind which Mr Cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow 
There is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at Donnybrook unless they are permanently in the mood of Enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable Irish 
We can all breathe more easily this morning  more easily and joyously too  because Joshua Logan has turned the stage show Fanny into a delightful and heart warming film 
The task of taking the raw material of Marcel Pagnol's original trio of French films about people of the waterfront in Marseilles and putting them again on the screen after their passage through the Broadway musical idiom was a delicate and perilous one indeed 
More than the fans of Pagnol's old films and of their heroic star the great Raimu were looking askance at the project 
The fans of the musical were too 
But now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the English dialogue picture at the Music Hall yesterday 
Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show whether partial to music or not you can't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart 
Some of the New York Philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow 
A tiny handful never did make the concert 
But after a fifteen minute delay the substantially complete Philharmonic assembled on stage for the afternoon's proceedings 
They faced a rather small audience as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon 
It was an excellent concert 
Paul Paray rounding out his current stint with the orchestra is a solid musician and the Philharmonic plays for him 
Their collaboration in the Beethoven Second Symphony was lucid intelligent and natural sounding 
It was not a heavy ponderous Beethoven 
The music sang nicely sprinted evenly when necessary was properly accented and balanced 
The Franck symphonic poem Psyche is a lush sweet sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again 
Fortunate for the music itself it is not too frequent a visitor  if it were its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying 
Mr Paray resisted the temptation to over emphasize the melodic elements of the score 
He did not let the strings for instance weep whine or get hysterical 
His interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy 
And in the Prokofieff *j major Piano Concerto with Zadel Skolovsky as soloist he was an admirable partner 
Mr Skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold sweeping and tonally percussive 
He swept through the music with ease in a non sentimental and ultra efficient manner 
An impressive technician Mr Skolovsky has fine rhythm to boot 
His tone is the weakest part of his equipment  it tends to be hard and colorless 
A school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs 
It is after all a non romantic work  even with the big juicy melody of the second movement   and the composer himself was called the age of steel pianist 
But granted all this one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than Mr Skolovsky supplied 
Taken as a whole though it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra 
Mr Skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received 
A new work on the program was Nikolai Lopatnikoff's Festival Overture receiving its first New York hearing 
This was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry 
It is not program music though 
It runs a little more than ten minutes is workmanlike busy methodical and featureless 
La Gioconda like it or not is a singer's opera 
And so of course it is a fan's opera as well 
Snow or no the fans were present in force at the Metropolitan Opera last night for a performance of the Ponchielli work 
So the plot creaks the sets are decaying the costumes are pre historic the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing 
After all the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed with no less than six leading parts 
One of those parts is that of evil evil Barnaba the spy 
His wicked deeds were carried on by Anselmo Colzani who was taking the part for the first time with the company 
He has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone 
What was lacking was a real sense of phrase the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is after all a very oily character 
Regina Resnik as Laura and Cesare Siepi as Alvise also were new to the cast but only with respect to this season  they have both sung these parts here before 
Laura is a good role for Miss Resnik and she gave it force dramatic color and passion 
Mr Siepi was as always a consummate actor  with a few telling strokes he characterized Alvise magnificently 
Part of this characterization was of course accomplished with the vocal chords 
His singing was strong and musical  unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality 
Eileen Farrell in the title role Mignon Dunn as La Cieca and Richard Tucker as Enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season and all contributed to a vigorous performance 
If only they and Fausto Cleva in the pit had got together a bit more 
Melodious birds sing madrigals saith the poet and no better description of the madrigaling of the Deller Consort could be imagined 
Their Vanguard album Madrigal Masterpieces  B*g 609  stereo *j 5031  is a good sample of the special elegant art of English madrigal singing 
It also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of Italian and English madrigals plus several French chansons 
The English have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else 
The original impulses came to England late  in the sixteenth century  and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque basso continuo sonatas operas and the like 
Even after Elizabethan traditions were weakened by the Cromwellian interregnum the practice of singing together  choruses catches and glees  always flourished 
The English never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way say the opera in Italy blotted out the Italian madrigal 
Early interest latter day interest in Elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in England much ahead of similar revivals in other countries 
As a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the English madrigal 
Naturally Mr Deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen  William Byrd Thomas Morley and Thomas Tomkins 
There is an almost instrumental quality to their singing with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture 
Both techniques give the music purity and clarity 
Claude Jannequin's vocal description of a battle  the French equivalents of tarantara rum tum tum and boom boom boom are very picturesque  is lots of fun and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by Jannequin and Lassus 
Only with the more sensual intense and baroque expressions of Marenzio Monteverdi and Gesualdo does the singing seem a little superficial 
Nevertheless the musicality accuracy and infectious charm of these performances excellently reproduced make it an attractive look see at the period 
The works are presented chronologically 
Texts and translations are provided 
Elegance and color the elements of elegance and color in Jannequin are strong French characteristics 
Baroque instrumental music in Italy and Germany tends to be strong lively intense controlled and quite abstract 
In France it remained always more picturesque more dancelike more full of flavor 
Couperin and Rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote not in the later sense of program music but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance 
Both composers turn up on new imports from France 
B*a*m is the unlikely name of a French recording company whose full label is Editions De La boite A Musique 
They specialize in out of the way items and old French music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention 
Sonates et Concerts Royaux of Couperin Le Grand occupy two disks  *j and *j and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of this master  delicate flexible and gemlike 
The Concerts  nos 2 6 9 10 and 14 are represented  are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the Italian sense 
The sonatas La Francaise La Sultane L'*astree and L'*imperiale are often more elaborately worked out and in fact show a strong Italian influence 
Couperin also turns up along with some lesser known contemporaries on a disk called Musique Francaise Du 18e Siecle  B*a*m 060  
Jean *marie Le*clair still is remembered a bit but Bodin De Beismortier Corrette and Mondonville are hardly household words 
What is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of French music that was moving toward the rococo 
The Couperin La Steinkerque with its battle music brevity wit and refined simplicity already shakes off Corelli and points towards the mid century elegances that ended the baroque era 
If Couperin shows the fashionable trend the others do so all the more 
All these records have close attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic 
Rameau's Six Concerts En Sextuor recorded by L'orchestre De Chambre Pierre Menet  B*a*m 046  turn out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself 
The strange delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious 
Maitres Allemands Des 17e et 18e Siecles contains music by Pachelbel Buxtehude Rosenmueller and Telemann well performed by the Ensemble Instrumental Sylvie Spycket  B*a*m 035  
Rococo music  a lot of it  was played in Carnegie Recital Hall on Saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known as Globe Concert Arts 
Works by J C Bach Anton Craft Joseph Haydn Giuseppe Sammartini Comenico Dragonetti and J G Janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including Anabel Brieff flutist Josef Marx oboist and Robert Conant pianist and harpsichordist 
Since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from Beethoven to Boulez 
Thus there was really an excess of eighteenth century charm as one of these light weight pieces followed another on Saturday night 
Each might find a useful place in a varied musical program but taken together they grew quite tiresome 
The performances were variable those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying some by soloists proving rather trying 
Ellie Mao soprano and Frederick Fuller baritone presented a program of folksongs entitled East Meets West in Carnegie Recital Hall last night 
They were accompanied by Anna Mi Lee pianist 
Selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages 
Songs from China and Japan were reserved exclusively for Miss Mao who is a native of China and those of the British Isles were sung by Mr Fuller who is English by birth 
This was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles 
On the contrary Miss Mao and Mr Fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as Mendelssohn Dvorak Canteloube Copland and Britten 
There was therefore more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise 
The performances were assured communicative and pleasingly informal 
What was omitted from A Neglected Education were those essentials known as the facts of life 
Chabrier's little one act operetta presented yesterday afternoon at Town Hall is a fragile precious little piece very French not without wit and charm 
The poor uneducated newlywed a certain Gontran De Boismassif has his problems in getting the necessary information 
The humor of the situation can be imagined 
It all takes place in the eighteenth century 
What a silly artificial way of life Chabrier and his librettists chuckle 
But they wish they could bring it back 
Chabrier's delightful music stands just at the point where the classical rationalist tradition  handed down to Chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music  becomes virtually neo classicism 
The musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish 
The simple clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes 
Arlene Saunders was charming as poor Gontran 
Yes Arlene is her name  the work uses the old eighteenth century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano 
Benita Valente was delightful as the young wife and John Parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring 
The work was presented as the final event in the Town Hall Festival of Music 
It was paired with a Darius Milhaud opera The Poor Sailor set to a libretto by Jean Cocteau a kind of Grand Guignol by the sea a sailor returns unrecognized and gets done in by his wife 
With the exception of a few spots Milhaud's music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties odd harmonies and lumbering satiric orchestration 
Had a funny experience at Newport yesterday afternoon 
Sat there and as a woman sang she kept getting thinner and thinner right before my eyes and the eyes of some 5 500 other people 
I make this observation about the lady Miss Judy Garland because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a British female reporter who flattered her terribly in London recently and then wrote in the paper the next day  Judy Garland has arrived in London 
She's not chubby 
She's not plump 
She's fat 
But who cares when the lady sings 
Certainly not the largest afternoon audience Newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet 
They applauded every number not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme  sometimes at the first chord 
And Judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed at times a blessed relief from the way out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings 
Things like When You're Smiling Almost Like Being In Love Do It Again Born To Wander Alone Together Who Cares 
 Puttin' On The Ritz How Long Has This Been Going On 
And her own personal songs like The Man That Got Away and the inevitable Over The Rainbow 
Miss Garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen 
At the start of her program there were evidences of pique 
She had held to the letter of her contract and didn't come onto the stage until well after 4 p m  the appointed hour although the Music at Newport people had tried to get the program underway at 3 
Then there was a bad delay in getting Mort Lindsey's 30 piece orchestra wedged into its chairs 
Along about 4 30 just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side Judy came on singing in a short skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind 
Her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing 
In her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm lenses and shoot at extreme range 
There also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of Do It Again and she made the tart observation that I never saw so much moving about in an audience 
But it didn't take Judy Garland showman long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at Newport and that you have to learn to live with it 
Before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind blown sheets of music trundling microphones about the stage helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere 
And time after time she really belted out her songs 
Sometimes they struck me as horribly over arranged  which was the way I felt about her Come Rain or Come Shine  and sometimes they were just plain magnificent like her shatteringly beautiful Beautiful Weather 
To her partisan audience such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise  they just sat back on their haunches and cried for more as though they could never get enough 
They were rewarded with splendid exciting singing 
Her Rockabye Your Baby was as good as it can be done and her really personal songs like The Man That Got Away were deeply moving 
The audience wouldn't let her leave until it had heard Over The Rainbow  although the fellow that kept crying for Get Happy had to go home unhappy about that item anyway 
She was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers 
All went home happy except the Newport police who feared that the throng departing at 6 35 might meet head on the night crowd drawing nigh and those deprived of their happy hour at the cocktail bar 
In Newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies 
This was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening  flashes in the distance but no storm 
Several times it came near breaking and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder from Jerry Mulligan's big band which is about as fine an aggregation as has come along in the jazz business since John Hammond found Count Basie working in a Kansas City trap 
Mulligan's band has been infected with his solid sense of swing and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations 
But what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and Mulligan's baritone sax in a fragile ballad like Bob Brookmeyer's arrangement of Django's Castle 
For subtle swinging rhythms I could admire intensely Mulligan's version of Weep and the fireworks went on display in 18 Carrots For Robert a sax tribute to Johnny Hodges 
There was considerable contrast between this Mulligan performance and that of Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group 
Unfortunately Blakey doesn't choose to work much of the time in this vein 
He prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like 
What we did get however was impressive 
A few drops of rain just before midnight when Sarah Vaughan was in the midst of her first number scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly but at this hour and with Sarah on the stand most of the listeners didn't care whether they got wet 
Miss Vaughan was back in top form somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time  like a fine wine 
After the spate of female vocalists we have been having all of whom took Sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever 
Jazz Three open program the evening program was opened by the Jazz Three a Newport group consisting of Steve Budieshein on bass Jack Warner drums and Don Cook piano 
This was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out Saturday night when the Eddie Stack group also local talent went on first 
Putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple purpose  it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot when the audience is cold restless and in flux  it prevents late comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous Newport audience 
The Jazz Three displayed their sound musicianship not only in their own chosen set but as the emergency accompanists for Al Minns & Leon James the superb jazz dancers who have now been Newport performers for three successive years gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program 
Julie Wilson sings Julie Wilson a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists sang a set a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old oldies as Hard *hearted Hannah The Vamp Of Savannah and the delightful Sunday 
She frosted the cake with the always reliable Bill Bailey 
From this taste of the 1920s we leaped way out to Stan Getz's private brand of progressive jazz which did lovely subtle things for Baubles Bangles And Beads and a couple of ballards 
Getz is a difficult musician to categorize 
He plays his sax principally for beauty of tone rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over 
In this he is sticking with tradition however far removed from it he may seem to be 
Shearing takes over George Shearing took over with his well disciplined group a sextet consisting of vibes guitar bass drums Shearing's piano and a bongo drummer 
He met with enthusiastic audience approval especially when he swung from jazz to Latin American things like the Mambo 
Shearing himself seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent Newport appearances 
A very casual pleasant program  one of those easy going things that make Newport's afternoon programs such a relaxing delight  was held again under sunny skies hot sun and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to Newport to hear music rather than go to the beach 
Divided almost equally into two parts it consisted of The Evolution Of The Blues narrated by Jon Hendricks who had presented it last year at the Monterey Calif  Jazz Festival and an hour long session of Maynard Ferguson and his orchestra a blasting big band 
Hendricks' story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right on stage with him 
Tracing the blues from its African roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the West Indies he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the Negro churches 
Surprise addition to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had Big Miller as a preacher singer and Hannah Dean Gospel singer while Oscar Brown Jr  an extremely talented young man did a slave auctioneer's call a field hands' work song and a beautifully sung Negro lullaby Brown Baby which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival 
One of those delightful surprise additions which so frequently occur in jazz programs was an excellent stint at the drums by the great Joe Jones drumming to Old Man River which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year's concerts 
Demonstrating the primitive African rhythmic backgrounds of the Blues was Michael Babatunde Olatunji who plays such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest 
He has been on previous Newport programs and was one of the sensations of last year's afternoon concerts 
Hendricks had Billy Mitchell tenor sax  Pony Poindexter alto sax  Jimmy Witherspoon Blues singer  and a good one  and the Ike Isaacs Trio which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now helping him with the musical examples 
It all went very well 
Pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in Schubert's Sonatas 
Music lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent example played for *j by Emil Gilels 
He has chosen Sonata Op 53 in *j 
The playing takes both sides of the disc 
Perhaps one of the reasons these Sonatas are not programmed more often is their great length 
Rhythmic interest melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing are all qualities which hold one's attention with the Gilels playing 
His technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully 
The male chorus of the Robert Shaw Chorale sings Sea Shanties in fine style 
The group is superbly trained 
What a discussion can ensue when the title of this type of song is in question 
Do you say chantey as if the word were derived from the French word chanter to sing or do you say shanty and think of a roughly built cabin which derives its name from the French *canadian use of the word chantier with one of its meanings given as a boat yard 
I say chantey 
Either way the Robert Shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spelled out in terms of agreeable listening 
If your favorite song is not here it must be an unfamiliar one 
The London label offers an operatic recital by Ettore Bastianini a baritone whose fame is international 
Murray Louis and his dance company appeared at the Henry Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work Signal and the repetition of an earlier one Journal 
Signal is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais 
Its abstract decor is by John Hultberg 
Program note reads as follows  take hands  this urgent visage beckons us 
Here as in Journal Mr Louis has given himself the lion's share of the dancing and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements 
Indeed both Journal and Signal qualify as instructive catalogues of modern dance calisthenics 
But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing 
One frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development 
It may be of course that Mr Louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation 
But it may be also that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time 
One thing is certain however and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be 
An American journey a brisk satirical spoof of contemporary American mores entitled An American Journey was given its first New York performance at Hunter College Playhouse last night by the Helen Tamiris *daniel Nagrin Dance Company 
Choreographed by Mr Nagrin the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first New York showing of Miss Tamiris' Once Upon A Time as well as her Women's Song and Mr Nagrin's Indeterminate Figure 
Eugene Lester assembled a witty and explicit score for An American Journey and Malcolm Mc*cormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes 
Mr Nagrin has described four places each with its scenery and people added two diversions and concluded with A Toccata for the Young a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock'n'roll dancing 
The places could be anywhere the idiosyncrasies and foibles observed there could be anybody's and the laugh is on us all 
But we need not mind too much because Mr Nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way 
Miss Tamiris' Once Upon A Time is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three figures that bother them somehow 
Unfortunately the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so 
Nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time 
The music here Russell Smith's Tetrameron sounded good 
All the performances of the evening were smooth and assured and the sizable company with Mr Nagrin and Marion Scott as its leading dancers seemed to be fine shape 
The Symphony Of The Air greatly assisted by Van Cliburn last night got its seven concert Beethoven cycle at Carnegie Hall off to a good start 
At the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty five programs at Carnegie and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs repeating each of them in five different communities 
This news announced by Jerome Toobin the orchestra's administrative director brought applause from the 2 800 persons who filled the hall 
They showed they were glad that Carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to Lincoln Center of the New York Philharmonic the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Boston Symphony 
This season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the Orchestral Society of Westchester in the County Center in White Plains 
The details of the suburban concerts next season and the centers in which they will be given will be announced later Mr Toobin said 
The concertos that Van Cliburn has been associated with in New York since his triumphant return from Russia in 1958 have been the Tchaikovsky the Rachmaninoff Third and the Prokofieff Third 
It was pleasant last night therefore to hear him do something else  a concerto he has recently recorded The Emperor 
The young Texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him 
But they were not what distinguished his performance 
The elements that did were the introspective slow movement the beautiful transition to the third movement and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final Rondo 
Mr Cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a Chopin Nocturne 
Alfred Wallenstein the conductor sensitive accompanist that he is picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding poetic mystery 
The collaboration was remarkable as it was in both the other movements too 
Mr Wallenstein who will lead all of the concerts in the cycle also conducted the Leonore Overture No 3 and the Fourth Symphony 
The orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively 
And although there was plenty of vigor in the performance the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of Beethoven 
Igor Oistrakh will be the next soloist on Feb 4 
There are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach Broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in 
Today in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over all development of the show it is understandable that a song no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it 
In the more casually constructed musicals of the Nineteen Twenties and Nineteen Thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit 
Yet there is the classic case of the Gershwins' The Man I Love 
Deemed too static when it was first heard in Lady Be Good in Philadelphia in 1924 it was dropped from the score 
It was heard again in Philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of Strike Up The Band and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given up 
It finally reached Broadway in the second and successful version of Strike Up The Band in 1929 
 still another song in Strike Up The Band  I've Got A Crush On You  was retrieved from a 1928 failure Treasure Girl 
 second chance like the Gershwins Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart were loath to let a good song get away from them 
If one of Mr Rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in Boston or the obscurity of a Broadway failure Mr Hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show 
Several of these double entries have been collected by Ben Bagley and Michael Mc*whinney along with Rodgers and Hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to New York and others that reached Broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard Rodgers and Hart repertory in a delightfully refreshing album Rodgers And Hart Revisited  Spruce Records 505 Fifth Avenue New York  
Among the particular gems in this collection is the impudent opening song of The Garrick Gaieties an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from Rodgers and Hart in the years that followed  Dorothy Loudon's raucous listing of the attractions At The Roxy Music Hall from I Married An Angel  and the incisive style with which Charlotte Rae delivers the top drawer Hart lyrics of I Blush a song that was cut from A Connecticut Yankee 
Altogether fifteen virtually unknown Rodgers and Hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists 
Norman Paris has provided them with extremely effective orchestral accompaniment 
Turning to the current musical season on Broadway the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying has been transferred to an original cast album  R C A Victor 1066  stereo *j 1066  that has some entertaining moments although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect 
Robert Morse singing with comically plaintive earnestness carries most of the burden and is responsible for the high spots in Frank Loesser's score 
Rudy Vallee who shares star billing with Mr Morse makes only two appearances 
He shares with Mr Morse a parody of the college anthems he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by Virginia Martin a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice 
In general Mr Loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer 
Like Mr Loesser Jerry Herman is both composer and lyriist for Milk And Honey  R C A Victor *j 1065  stereo *j 1065  but in this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics 
For this story of an American couple who meet and fall in love in Israel Mr Herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles 
Resourceful voices there are the full bodied resourceful voices of Robert Weede Mimi Benzell and Tommy Rall to make the most of Mr Herman's lilting melodies and for an occasional change of pace the bright humor of Molly Picon 
Mr Herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from Israel and the standard American ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms 
Not content to create only the music and lyrics Noel Coward also wrote the book and directed Sail Away  Capitol *j 1643  stereo *j 1643  a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among Mr Coward's more memorable works 
The melodies flow along pleasantly as Mr Coward's songs usually do but his lyrics have a tired cut to a familiar pattern quality 
Elaine Stritch who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness belts some life into most of her songs but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as Mr Coward's songs 
With three fine Russian films in recent months on World War 2  The House I Live In The Cranes Are Flying and Ballad Of A Soldier  we had every right to expect a real Soviet block buster in The Day The War Ended 
It simply isn't not by a long shot 
The Artkino presentation with English titles opened on Saturday at the Cameo Theatre 
Make no mistake this Gorky Studio drama is a respectable import  aptly grave carefully written performed and directed 
In describing the initial Allied occupation of a middle sized German city the picture has color pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments 
Told strictly from the viewpoint of the Russian conquerors the film compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten Soviet couple at both sides of the conflict's aftermath 
Unfortunately the whole picture hinges on this romance at the expense of everything else 
Tenderly and rather tediously the camera rivets on the abrupt deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher complicated by nothing more than a friend they don't want to hurt 
It's the old story war or no war and more than one viewer may recall Hollywood's Titanic several seasons back when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of a society dilettante 
Not that the picture is superficial 
Under Yakov Segal's direction it begins stirringly as crouching Soviet and Nazi troops silently scan each other waiting for the first surrender gesture 
One high up camera shot is magnificent as the Germans straggle from a cathedral dotting a huge cobblestone square and drop their weapons 
Ring Of Bright Water by Gavin Maxwell 
211 pages 
Dutton 
$5 
Only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience 
Ring Of Bright Water by Gavin Maxwell is just that  a haunting warmly personal chronicle of a man an otter and a remote cottage in the Scottish West Highlands 
He has married me with a ring of bright water begins the Kathleen Raine poem from which Maxwell takes his title and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys 
The place is Camusfearna the site of a long vanished sea village opposite the isle of Skye 
It is a land of long fjords few people a single lane road miles away  and of wild stags Greylag geese wild swans dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters 
How Maxwell recounts his first coming to Camusfearna his furnishing the empty house with beach drift the subtle changes in season over ten years is a moving experience 
Just the evocations of time and place of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost would be enough 
But it isn't 
There is Mijbil an otter who travelled with Maxwell  and gave Maxwell's name to a new species  from the Tigris marshes to his London flat 
It may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in all literature 
This is not only a compliment to Mijbil of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub's journey by plane from Iraq to London then by train  where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap  to Camusfearna with affectionate detail 
Mij as his owner was soon to learn had strange inexplicable habits 
He liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle sharp teeth 
He preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow 
Systematically he would open and ransack drawers 
Given a small ball or marbles he would invent games and play by himself for hours 
With curiosity and elan he explored every inch of glen beach and burn once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell who nearly lost his life in doing so 
A year and a day of this idyll is described for the reader one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is charted but self discovery as well 
In the solitude of Camusfearna there had been no loneliness 
To be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating  it is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted allowing an intense awareness a sharpening of the senses 
Now with the increasing interdependence between himself and Mij came a knowledge of an obscure need that of being trusted implicitly by some creature 
Two other people in time shared Mijbil's love  it remained around us three that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water  we were his Trinity and he behaved towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse passion and irritation 
In turn each of us in our own way depended as gods do upon his worship 
Yet the idyll ended 
The brief details of Mijbil's death lend depth to the story give it an edge of ironic tragedy 
Man to whom Mij gave endless affection and fealty was responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man 
But then through a strange coincidence Maxwell manages to acquire Idal a female otter and the fascinating story starts once more 
One is not sure who emerges as the main personality of this book  Mijbil with his rollicking ways or Maxwell himself poet portrait painter writer journalist traveller and zoologist sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way of life in a language at once lyrical and forceful vivid and unabashed 
This reviewer read the book when it was first brought out in England with a sense of discovery and excitement 
Now Gavin Maxwell's Ring Of Bright Water has widened to enchant the world 
New York  the performances of the Comedie Francaise are the most important recent events in the New York theater 
They serve to contradict a popular notion that the Comedie merely repeats as accurately as possible the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the 17th century 
On the contrary the old plays are continually being reinterpreted and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the Comedie 
Of course the well received revivals last longer than the others and that further reminds us that the Comedie is not insensitive to criticism 
The directors of the Comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the Broadway producers who in two instances this season closed their plays after one performance 
But they are aware of the world outside they court public approval they delight in full houses and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic 
In France novel approaches to the classic French plays are frequently attempted 
The government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put Moliere's characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results 
So far as I know the Comedie has never put Moliere's people in the costumes of the 20th century but they do reinterpret plays and characters 
Last season the Comedie's two principal experiments came to grief and in consequence we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of Racine's Phedre and Moliere's School For Wives 
The new Phedre was done in 17th century setting instead of ancient Greek  perhaps that is the Comedie's equivalent for thrusting this play's characters into our own time 
The speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17th century elegance 
A few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent 
The new School For Wives was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy  the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character 
Among the Moliere specialists of some years ago Louis Jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns while Fernand Ledoux often performing at the Comedie made them more gross than Moliere may have intended 
Apparently Jouvet and Ledoux attempted just these dissimilar approaches in the role of Arnolphe in The School For Wives 
I say apparently although I saw Jouvet as Arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death  by that time he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy 
Arnolphe it will be recalled is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife to be 
The part can lend itself to serious treatment  one influential French critic remarked  pity for Arnolphe comes with age 
Accordingly at the Comedie last year Jean Meyer played a sympathetic Arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy 
But the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly 
Wisely the Comedie has brought Moliere's Tartuffe on its tour and has left The School For Wives at home 
Tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactor's wife 
Jouvet played him as a sincere zealot and Ledoux at the Comedie made him a gross buffoon or so the historians tell us 
Louis Seigner who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite Ledoux is the Tartuffe of the present production which he himself directed 
His Tartuffe observes the golden mean 
His red face his coarse gestures and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality 
But his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory  of course they do not reflect sincerity but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation 
Occasionally Seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another 
The whole role by the way is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen Seigner in his other parts 
His normal specialty is playing the good natured old man frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly 
Here he is quite persuasively the very embodiment of meanness and slyness 
Seigner is the dean of the company the oldest actor in point of continuous service 
In that function he helps to rebut another legend about the Comedie 
We are often told that the Comedie has unfortunately life contracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the Comedie by staying off the stage 
Seigner however is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company  among his other parts are the leads in The Bourgeois Gentleman and The Imaginary Invalid 
In Moliere's farce The Tricks Of Scapin Robert Hirsch undertakes another of the great roles 
Here some innovation is attempted 
To begin with Scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master 
Hirsch's Scapin is healthy cheerful energetic revelling in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves 
Hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city toughs of the real world 
And surely his Scapin has a fresh directness a no nonsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody's servant 
Django Reinhardt the ill fated gypsy was a true artist one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels 
There is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who doesn't owe something to Django 
And Django owed much to Louis Armstrong 
He told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old Armstrong records he bought in the Flea Market in Paris 
It was the first jazz he had heard 
Django who was born Jean Baptiste Reinhardt in Belgium and who died in 1953 in France was an extraordinary man 
Most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette 
And this was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful jazz 
You can catch up with him  if you haven't already  on *j album 
Djangology made up of tracks he recorded with Stephane Grappelly and the Quintet of the Hot Club of France 
This is a choice item and Grappely deserves mention too of course 
He is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin 
They play  Minor Swing Honeysuckle Rose Beyond The Sea Bricktop Heavy Artillery Djangology After You've Gone Where Are You My Love 
I Saw Stars Lover Man Menilmontant and Swing 42 
All this is great proceedings  get the minutes 
Kid Ory the trombonist chicken farmer is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz 
He dates back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into New Orleans 
His horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years than he cares to remember 
Good Time Jazz has released a nice two record album which he made 
He is starred against Alvin Alcorn trumpet  Phil Gomez clarinet  Cedric Haywood piano  Julian Davidson guitar  Wellman Braud bass and Minor Hall drums 
The set contains High Society Do What Ory Say Down Home Rag Careless Love Jazz Me Blues Weary Blues Original Dixieland One *step Bourbon Street Parade Panama Toot Toot Tootsie Oh Didn't He Ramble Beale Street Blues Maryland My Maryland 1919 Rag Eh La Bas Mood Indigo and Bugle Call Rag 
All this will serve to show off the Ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the old time jazz before it is too late to lay hands on the gems 
Mischa Elman shared last night's Lewisohn Stadium concert with three American composers 
His portion of the program  and a big portion it was  consisted of half the major nineteenth century concertos for the violin  to wit the Mendelssohn and the Tchaikovsky 
That is an evening of music making that would faze many a younger man  Mr Elman is 70 years old 
There were 8 000 persons at the Stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard Elman 
But with all due respects and allowances it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet more mannered than musical 
The occasion was sentimental  so was the playing 
The American part of the evening consisted of Paul Creston's Dance Overture William Schuman's Chester From New England Triptych and two works of Wallingford Riegger Dance Rhythms Op 58 and a Romanza For Strings Op 56*a 
The Creston is purely a potboiler with Spanish English French and American dances mixed into the stew 
The Riegger with its Latin hesitation bounce is just this side of the pale  like his sweet attractive Romanza it belongs to what the composer called his Non *dissonant  mostly  category of works 
The Schuman Chester takes off from an old William Billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect 
All these  potboilers or no  provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively colorful unstuffy works well suited for the great out of doors 
It was nice to have something a little up to date for a change 
We have Alfredo Antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well as the lively performances of the Stadium Symphony 
A woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of A Question Of Adultery yesterday's new British import at the Apollo 
Since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise the film's extensive discussion of the problem seems at best superfluous 
In its present artless low budget form the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath 
With Julie London enacting the central role with husky voiced sincerity the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive 
The explanation offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile accident 
Anthony Steel as the husband is a jealous type who argues against her course and sues for divorce labeling her action adulterous 
The actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction of Don Chaffey as do Basil Sydney as his unsympathetic father and Anton Diffring as an innocent bystander 
After a protracted hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility the jury to no one's surprise leaves the legal question unresolved 
When the husband drops the case and returns to his wife both seem sorry they brought the matter up in the first place 
So was the audience 
London July 4 for its final change of bill in its London season the Leningrad State Kirov Ballet chose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a gala program at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden 
No doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far it too could give a circus if it pleased 
And please it did in every sense of the word for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of London audiences 
At the end of the program indeed there was a demonstration that lasted for forty five minutes and nothing could stop it 
Alexandre Livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number Taras Bulba but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go home at all 
Only a plea from the house manager John Collins finally broke up the party 
But for all the manifest intention to show off this was a circus with a difference for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company 
The Taras Bulba excerpt is a rousing version of Gogol's Ukrainian folk tale choreographed by Bo Fenster to music of Soloviev *sedoi 
It is danced by some thirty five men and no women and it contains everything in the books  lusty comedy gregarious cavorting and tricks that only madmen or Russians would attempt to make the human body perform 
Yuri Soloviev Oleg Sokolov Alexei Zhitkov Lev Sokolov Yuri Korneyev and Mr Livshitz were the chief soloists but everybody on stage was magnificent 
At the other extreme in character was the half hour excerpt from the Petipa *minkus ballet Bayaderka which opened the evening 
What a man this Petipa was ] and why do we in the West know so few of his ballets 
This scene is a white ballet in which a lovelorn hero searches for his departed love's spirit among twenty eight extraordinarily beautiful shadows who can all dance like nothing human  which of course is altogether fitting 
The ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty as well as loveliness and adagio is the general medium of the piece 
Its ballerina Olga Moiseyeva performs simple miracles of beauty and Ludmilla Alexeyeva Inna Korneyeva and Gabrielle Komleva make up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments 
Sergei Vikulov as the lone male meets the competition well with some brilliant hits but the work is designed to belong to the ladies 
The middle section of the program was made up of short numbers naturally enough of unequal merit but all of them pretty good at that 
They consisted of a new arrangement of Nutcracker excerpts danced stunningly by Irina Kolpakova and Mr Sokolev with a large ensemble  a winning little Snow Maiden variation by the adorable Galina Kekisheva  two of those poetic adagios in Greek veils  and superb esthetic acrobacy  by Alla Osipenko and Igor Chernishev in one case and Inna Zubkovskaya and Yuri Kornevey in the other  an amusing character pas de cinq called Gossiping Women  a stirring Flames Of Paris pas de deux by Xenia Ter *stepanova and Alexandre Pavlovsky and a lovely version of Fokine's Le Cygne by Olga Moiseyeva which had to be repeated 
Vadim Kalentiev was the conductor 
It was quite an evening ] a year ago today when the Democrats were fretting and frolicking in Los Angeles and John F Kennedy was still only an able and ambitious Senator who yearned for the power and responsibility of the Presidency Theodore H White had already compiled masses of notes about the Presidential campaign of 1960 
As the pace of the quadrennial American political festival accelerated Mr White took more notes 
He traveled alternately with Mr Kennedy and with Richard M Nixon 
He asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates' in groups 
He assembled quantities of facts about the nature of American politics in general as well as about the day to day course of the closest Presidential election in American history 
Those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election  how little we know of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by Mr White in The Making Of The President 1960 
This is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one 
What might have been only warmed over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history 
Mr White who is only a competent novelist is a brilliant reporter 
His zest for specific detail his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book 
A lesson in politics as a dramatic narrative The Making Of The President 1960 is continuously engrossing 
And as an introduction to American politics it is highly educational 
The author begins this volume with a close up of Mr Kennedy his family and his entourage waiting for the returns 
He then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal Presidential hopefuls  five Democrats  Senator Hubert H Humphrey Senator Stuart Symington Senator Lyndon B Johnson Adlai E Stevenson and Mr Kennedy  and two Republicans  Governor Rockefeller and Mr Nixon 
Then in chronological order Mr White covers the primary campaigns the conventions and the Presidential campaign itself 
In the process he writes at length about many related matters  the importance of race religion local tradition bosses organizations zealous volunteers and television 
Mr White is bluntly frank in his personal opinions 
He frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse's mouth from numerous insiders and from Mr Kennedy himself  but never from Mr Nixon who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust 
Rarely in American history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less says Mr White 
Mr Nixon he believes has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign 
Although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man Mr Nixon Mr White believes ignored his own top level planners wasted time and effort in the wrong regions missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television 
Mr Nixon is a broody moody man given to long stretches of introspection  he trusts only himself and his wife 
He is a man of major talent  but a man of solitary uncertain impulses 
He was above all a friend seeker almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked 
He wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them  the least inspiring candidate since Alfred M Landon 
Mr Kennedy Mr White believes had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other American could match him 
Calm dignified composed superbly eloquent Mr Kennedy always knew everything about everybody 
He enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers 
Every decision was made quickly on sound grounds 
Efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance 
Mr Kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters 
Mr White admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a Democrat himself who expects Mr Kennedy to be a fine President 
Pressures portrayed throughout The Making Of A President Mr White shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates how decisions have constantly to be made how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down how subordinates play key roles 
And he makes many interesting comments 
Here are several  the root question in American politics is always  who's the man to see 
To understand American politics is simply to know people to know the relative weight of names  who are heroes who are straw men who controls who does not 
But to operate in American politics one must go a step further  one must build a bridge to such names establish a warmth a personal connection 
In the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major American party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion 
All platforms are meaningless  the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it 
Nostalgia week at Lewisohn Stadium which had begun with the appearance of the 70 year old Mischa Elman on Tuesday night continued last night as Lily Pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of French operatic excerpts 
Miss Pons is certainly not 70  no singer ever is  and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present accomplishments 
The better part of gallantry might be perhaps to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow hued gown and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing 
No orchestra however could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as Miss Pons encountered last night 
In all fairness there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear flashes even of the old consummate vocalism 
One such moment came in the breathtaking way Miss Pons sang the cadenza to Meyerbeer's Shadow Song 
The years suddenly fell away at this point 
On the whole however one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on 
Sharing the program was the young French *canadian tenor Richard Verreau making his stadium debut on this occasion 
Mr Verreau began shakily with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume 
Later on this problem vanished and the Flower Song from Bizet's Carmen was beautifully and intelligently projected 
Radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener 
Lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible 
The mushrooming of *j outlets offering concerts  both jazz and classical  lectures and other special events is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity 
Not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at Negro listeners  an audience which in the United States comprises some 19 000 000 people with $20 000 000 000 to spend each year 
Of course the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching 
He even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised  despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials 
But the growing number of Negro appeal radio stations plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects 
It is estimated that more than 600 stations  of a total of 3 400  do a significant amount of programing for the Negro 
At least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states 
These and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of Sponsor magazine a trade publication for radio and *j advertisers 
For 10 years Sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the Negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio 
In the past 10 years Sponsor observes these trends have become apparent  Negro population in the U *s has increased 25 per cent while the white population was growing by 18 per cent 
The forgotten 15 million  as Sponsor tagged the Negro market in its first survey  has become a better remembered 19 million 
Advertisers are changing their attitudes both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it 
Stations programing to Negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational economic and cultural levels 
Futhermore the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects not simply serve on the air 
In the last decade the number of Negro appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15 per cent and the number of Negro appeal stations has increased 30 per cent according to a research man quoted by Sponsor 
A year ago the Negro Radio Association was formed to spur research which the 30 odd member stations are sure will bring in more business 
The 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population growth 
It also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed  that more than half of the U *s Negroes live outside the southeastern states 
Also the state with the largest number of Negroes is New York  not in the South at all 
In New York City *j boasts more community service programs than any other Negro station and one of the largest Negro news staffs in America 
And *j colorful mobile unit cruising predominately Negro neighborhoods is a frequent reminder of that station's round the clock dedication to nonwhite interests 
Recently *j won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment agency deceit 
A half dozen other stations in the New York area also bid for attention of the city's Negro population up about 50 per cent in the past decade 
In all big cities outside the South and even in small towns within the South radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at Negro listeners 
The Keystone Broadcasting System's Negro network includes 360 affiliated stations whose signals reach more than half the total U *s Negro population 
One question which inevitably crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the Negro is moving into a fully integrated status 
Whatever the long range impact of integration the owners of Negro appeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal 
Advertisers have discovered the tendency of Negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests 
And many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a Negro disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words working only from a fact sheet 
What sets Negro appeal programing apart from other radio shows 
Sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular Negro bands and singers  rhythm and blues mood music  race music folk songs and melodies and gospel programs 
Furthermore news and special presentations inform the listener about groups projects and personalities rarely mentioned on a general appeal station 
Advertising copy frequently takes into account matters of special Negro concern 
Sponsor quotes John Mc*lendon of the Mc*lendon *ebony station group as saying that the Southern Negro is becoming conscious of quality and does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race  he tends to shy away from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made Negro radio programs famous 
The sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed up in this quotation of J Walter Carroll of *j San Francisco  Negro appeal radio is more important to the Negro today because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the Negro can hear and see his ambitions achievements and desires 
It will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the Negro seeking to become urbanized as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life 
Negro radio is vitally necessary during the process of assimilation 
Presentation of The Life And Times Of John Sloan in the Delaware Art Center here suggests a current nostalgia for human values in art 
Staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate Sloan collection by the artist's widow Helen Farr Sloan to the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts the exhibition presents a survey of Sloan's work 
From early family portraits painted before he entered the schools of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed in his last year  1951  and still part of his estate 
Few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived 
Few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness 
The paintings drawings prints and illustrations all reflect the manners costumes and mores of America in the first half of the present century 
Obviously Sloan's early years were influenced by his close friend Robert Henri 
As early as 1928 however the Sloan style began to change 
The dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette 
The solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of American genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes 
The exhibition presents all phases of Sloan's many sided art 
In addition to the paintings are drawings prints and illustrations 
Sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of New York thereby building for America an incomparable city survey from paintings of Mc*sorley's Saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs 
One of the most appealing of the rooftop canvases is Sun And Wind On The Roof with a woman and child bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds 
Although there are landscapes in the show  one of the strongest is a vista of Gloucester Harbor in 1915  the human element was the compelling factor in Sloan's art 
Significant are such canvases as Bleeker Street Saturday Night with its typically American crowd  Sloan never went abroad   the multifigure Traveling Carnival in which action is vivified by lighting  or Carmine Theater 1912 the only canvas with an ash can  and foraging dog  although Sloan was a member of the famous Eight and of the so called Ash *can School a term he resented 
Not all the paintings however are of cities 
The exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the Southwest  Koshare in the Dust a vigorous Indian dance and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette  
The fact that Sloan was an extrovert concerned primarily with what he saw adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle 
There are 151 items in the Wilmington show including one painting by each member of the Eight as well as work by Sloan's friends and students 
Supplementing the actual art are memorabilia  correspondence diaries books from the artist's library etc 
All belong to the collection being given to Wilmington over a period of years by Mrs Sloan who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with Sloan at the Art Students League New York in the 1920's 
To enable students and the public to spot Sloan forgeries the Delaware Art Center  according to its director Bruce St John  will maintain a complete file of photographs of all Sloan works as well as a card index file 
The entire Sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art students and historians 
The current exhibition which remains on view through Oct 29 has tapped 14 major collections and many private sources 
Any musician playing Beethoven here where Beethoven was born is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care 
In a sense he is offering Bonn what its famous son  who left as a youth  never did  the sound of the composer's mature style 
Robert Riefling who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23rd Beethoven Festival penetrated deep into the spirit of the style 
His readings were careful without being fussy and they were authoritative without being presumptuous 
The 32 *j Minor Variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline 
The *j Minor Sonata Op 31 No 2 introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios was most engaging in its moments of quasi recitative  single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come 
These inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind of opera style of which Beethoven was genuinely capable but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging 
Two late Sonatas Op 110 and 111 were played with similar insight the disarming simplicities of the Op 111 Adagio made plain without ever becoming obvious 
The two were separated from each other by the Six Bagatelles of Op 126 
Herr Riefling in everything he gave his large Beethoven Hall audience proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority 
Volker Wangenheim who conducted Bonn's Stadtisches Orchester on the following evening made one more conscious of the process of interpretation 
Herr Wangenheim has only recently become the city's music director and is a young man with a clear flair for the podium 
But he weighted the Eighth Symphony at times with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at odds with the music 
He might have been hoping to all appearances that this relatively sunny symphony in conjunction with the Choral Fantasy at the end of the program could amount to something like the Ninth  but no amount of head tossing could make it so 
The conductor's preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness as with the first orchestra entrance in the Fourth Piano Concerto but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed it did so with plenty of spring 
The concerto's soloist Hans Richter *haaser played with compensatory ease and economy though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by Herr Riefling 
His was a burgomaster's Beethoven solid and sensible 
Everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the Fantasy For Piano Chorus And Orchestra In *j Minor made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs 
The entrance of the Stadtisches Gesangverein  Bonn's civic chorus  was worth all the waiting however as the young Rhenish voices finally brought the music to life 
The last program of this festival which during two weeks had sampled most compositional categories brought the Cologne Rundfunk *sinfonie *orchesternp and Rundfunkchor to Bonn's gold filled hall for a performance of the Missa Solemnis 
A tribe in ancient India believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise 
This theory eventually proved inexact 
But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science 
It is the business of cosmologists the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors 
These keys are the working principles of physics mathematics and astronomy principles which are then extrapolated or projected to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge 
In the autumn of 1959 the British Broadcasting Corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology 
Three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator 
The participants were Professor H Bondi professor of mathematics at King's College London  Dr W B Bonnor reader in mathematics at Queen Elizabeth College London  Dr R A Lyttleton a lecturer at St John's College Cambridge and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the University of Cambridge  and Dr G J Whitrow reader in applied mathematics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology London 
Dr Whitrow functioned as moderator 
The programs were so well received by the British public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called Rival Theories Of Cosmology 
Dr Bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe based on the general theory of relativity 
First of all and this has been calculated by observation the universe is expanding  that is the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds 
Because of this Dr Bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there 
This expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years 
Expands and contracts Dr Bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in 
Then after many more billions of years when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center this movement will slow down and reverse itself again 
Professor Bondi disagrees with the expansion contraction theory 
He supports the steady state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space 
For this reason he says the density of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are zooming away in all directions 
New galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies 
If this is true then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence even though the universe is expanding 
For new galaxies to be created Professor Bondi declares it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years 
He contends this idea doesn't conflict with experiments on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments 
Dr Lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons 
Protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen  the basic building block of matter 
The charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite but Dr Lyttleton is not so sure 
Suppose says Dr Lyttleton the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron  so slight it is presently immeasurable  
This would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge excess 
Now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge excess of all those atoms in the sphere 
Because electrical forces  the charge excess  are far more powerful than gravitation the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot away from the sphere 
Dr Lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it 
This he claims would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe 
Fleeting glimpse this slim book while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe has the appeal that informed conversation always has 
Several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non scientist keep up with the discussion and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field 
It is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science 
Presently the intense absorption of ultra violet rays in the earth's atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation 
These scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth's gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories 
There would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us giving us a long sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions 
In doing away with the tea tray the elephants and the giant tortoise science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos 
And although the universe may forever defy understanding it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man 
Roots the new play at the brand new Mayfair Theater on 46th St which has been made over from a night club is about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an English farm girl 
Highly successful in England before its transfer to New York most of Roots is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy 
Only in its final scene where Beatie Bryant  Mary Doyle  shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and one half acts 
The burden of Mr Wesker's message is that people living close to the soil  at least in England  are not the happy fine strong natural earthy people city bred intellectuals imagine 
Rather they are genuine clods proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought 
They care no more for politics says Mr Wesker than they do for a symphony 
Seeming to have roots in the soil they actually have none in life 
They dwell in short in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived 
But this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as Mr Wesker dedicates to it 
So much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer  unless he has been living in a gilded palace perhaps and wants a real big heap of contrast  
The messy meals the washing of dishes the drying of clothes may be realism but there is such a thing as redundancy 
Now for the good points 
Miss Doyle as Beatie has a great fund of animal spirits a strong voice and a warm smile 
She is just home from a sojourn in London where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named Ronnie  we never do see him  and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating including a dose of good British socialism 
But while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open before her Ronnie has not been able to observe her progress and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull he sends Beatie a letter of dismissal 
Beatie getting no sympathy for her misfortune soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom 
Despite a too long sustained declamatory flight this final speech is convincing and we see why British audiences apparently were impressed by Roots 
There were several fairly good minor portraits in the play including William Hansen's impersonation of a stubborn rather pathetic father and Katherine Squire's vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brooked no hifalutin' nonsense from her daughter or anyone else 
But I am afraid Mr Wesker's meat and potatoes dish isn't well seasoned enough for local audiences 
Shakespeare had a word for everything even for the rain that disrupted Wednesday night's Much Ado About Nothing opening the season of free theatre in Central Park 
The New York Shakespeare Festival which is using the Wollman Memorial Skating Rink while its theatre near the Belvedere is being completed began bravely 
Joseph Papp impassioned founder of the festival and director of Much Ado had a vibrant colorful production under way 
Using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with Shakespeare's words in a spirited mixture 
The audience filled all the seats inside the Wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence 
The barbed sallies of Beatrice and Benedick so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult raised chuckles 
The simple minded comedy of Dogberry and Verges also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers' heads evoked laughter 
The vivacity of the masquers' party at Leonato's palace with the Spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting Prince of Arragon cast a spell of delight 
As Much Ado turned serious while the insipid Claudio rejected Hero at the altar a sprinkle began to fall 
At first hardly a person in the audience moved although some umbrellas were opened 
But the rain came more heavily and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart 
The grieving Hero and her father Leonato followed by the Friar left the stage 
A voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes 
More than half the audience departed 
Some remained in the Wollman enclosure fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads 
Others huddled under the trees outside the fence 
Twenty minutes after the interruption although it was still raining the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped 
Beatrice  Nan Martin  and Benedick  J D Cannon  took their places on the stage 
In their very first speeches it was clear that Shakespeare like a Nostradamus had foreseen this moment 
Said Benedick  Lady Beatrice have you wept all this while 
Replied Beatrice  yea and I will weep a while longer 
The heavens refused to give up their weeping 
The gallant company completed Act 4 and got through part of Act 5 
But the final scenes could not be played 
If any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes out let them take comfort 
Much Ado ends happily 
The Parks Department has done an admirable job of preparing the Wollman Rink for Shakespeare 
One could hardly blame Newbold Morris the Parks Commissioner for devoting so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms its balcony its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains 
Eldon Elder who designed the stage also created a gay spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and Shakespeare's lighthearted mood 
Mr Papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable 
Elisabeth Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday night at Hunter College that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints 
Still a demurrer or two must be entered 
Schwarzkopf is of course Schwarzkopf 
For style and assurance for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her 
If the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be it is still a beautiful instrument controlled and flexible 
Put to the service of lieder of Schubert Brahms Strauss and Wolf in a dramatical and musical way it made its effect with ease and precision 
But what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism 
Instead of her old confidence in the simplest purest most moving musical expression Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride  that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside 
The symptoms Saturday night were unmistakable 
Clever light songs were overly coy tragic songs a little too melodramatic 
There was an extra pause here a gasp or a sigh there here and there an extra little twist of a word or note all in the interest of effect 
The result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness 
There were stunning musical phrases too and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication 
Miss Schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist John Wustman often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition 
All the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills  Miss Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them 
The dance dancers and dance enthusiasts  8 500 of them  had a much better time of it at Lewisohn Stadium on Saturday night than all had had two nights earlier when Stadium Concerts presented the first of two dance programs 
On Saturday the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing and the order of the program improved 
There was additionally a bonus for the Saturday night patrons 
Alvin Ailey and Carmen De Lavallade appeared in the first New York performance of Mr Ailey's Roots Of The Blues a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the Boston Arts Festival 
Otherwise the program included as on Thursday the Taras *tchaikovsky Design For Strings the Dollar *britten Divertimento the Dollar *de Banfield The Duel and the pas de deux from The Nutcracker 
Maria Tallchief and Erik Bruhn who danced the Nutcracker pas de deux were also seen in the Petipa *minkus pas de deux from Don Quixote another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely 
Among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening Elisabeth Carroll and Ivan Allen were particularly impressive in their roles in The Duel a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants 
Mr Ailey's Roots Of The Blues an earthy and very human modern dance work provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening 
As Brother John Sellers sang five blues to the guitar and drum accompaniments of Bruce Langhorne and Shep Shepard Mr Ailey and Miss De Lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating threatening contemptuous and ecstatic 
Their props were two stepladders a chair and a palm fan 
He wore the clothes of a laborer and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress 
The cat like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps lifts crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong sometimes almost frightening tensions 
Roots Of The Blues may not be for gentle souls but others should welcome its super charged impact 
Perhaps it is better to stay at home 
The armchair traveler preserves his illusions 
This somewhat cynical comment may be found in Blue Skies Brown Studies a collection of travel essays by William Sansom who would never consider staying home for long 
Mr Sansom is English bearded formidably cultivated the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between 
The only man alive who seems qualified by his learning his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell Sitwell Mr Sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a Hungarian beauty  her third  and an American multimillionaire  his fourth  
The result is rather wonderful but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices 
There are sixteen essays in Blue Skies Brown Studies 
Most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines 
All are well written and are overwritten 
But even if Mr Sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow he still can charm and astound 
Too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another 
Mr Sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of English with a thick shower of sophisticated cultural references 
A contemplative connoisseur I like to sniff a place and reproduce what it really smells and looks like its color its particular kind of life 
This is an exact description of what Mr Sansom does 
He ignores guidebook facts 
He only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions 
It is an over all impression Mr Sansom strives for an impression compounded of visual details of a savory mixture of smells of much loving attention to architecture and scenery of lights and shadows of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past 
William Sansom writes only about Europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as London Vienna the French Riviera and the Norwegian fjords 
But no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions 
A writer lives at best in a state of astonishment he says 
Beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all 
To transmit that feeling he writes 
This may not be true of many writers but it certainly is true of Mr Sansom 
So in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St Torpetius that still persists in St Tropez  at the sun and the heat of Mediterranean lands always much brighter and hotter to an Englishman than to an American used to summers in New York or Kansas City  at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world's finest restaurants La Bonne Auberge which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the Nice airport  and at the infinite variety of London 
Mr Sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls  to those who recall easily  the statues of Bernini and the gigantic paintings of Tintoretto 
He can coin a neat phrase  a street spattered with an invigoration of people  tulips with petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel's ears  after a snowstorm a landscape smelling of woodsmoke and clarity 
And for all his lacquered almost Byzantine self consciousness he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison 
Beauty borrowed from afar in one of his best essays Mr Sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by Andrea Palladio himself that dot the environs of Vicenza 
How far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence Mr Sansom reminds us thus  the white colonnaded cedar roofed Southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey skied England to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue South the Palladian orbit stretching out from Vicenza  the old mind of Andrea Palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a Southern porch the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips 
Nice even if a trifle gaudy 
Blue Skies Brown Studies is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs 
In recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio 
W*b*a*i the listener supported outlet on the frequency modulation band has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void 
Yesterday it offered Poised For Violence by Jean Reavey 
W*b*a*i is on the right track  in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre as the Canadian and British Broadcasting Corporations continue to demonstrate 
Unfortunately Poised For Violence was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point 
Mrs Reavey's work is written for the stage  it is mentioned for an off *broadway production in the fall  and in addition employs an avant garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged 
The play's device is to explore society's obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist's models who remain part of someone else's painting rather than just be themselves 
In a succession of scenes they appear in different guises  patrons of a cafe performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic  but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty 
Somewhere in Mrs Reavey's play there is both protest and aspiration of merit 
But its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener's stamina begins to wilt 
Moreover her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind's ills 
But quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author's words 
Which in itself is an immediate reward of the *j experiment  good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration 
A weekly showcase for contemporary music from the austere archaism of Stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month 
Titled What's New In Music 
The enterprising program is heard Saturday afternoons on radio station *j 
The brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze 
The show is programed and written by the station's assistant continuity editor Chuck Briefer 
The first Saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings 
Last Saturday's interesting melange included Ernst Toch Karlheinz Stockhausen Richard Yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new space opera by the Swedish composer Karl *birger Blomdahl 
Other Saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected American composer a particular type of music or the music of a given country 
It is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene 
But one wishes when the appetite is whetted as it was in the case of the all too brief excerpt from the Blomdahl opera that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions 
The Moiseyev Dance Company dropped in at Madison Square Garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long American tour to a close 
It is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its New York engagement earlier this season but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody's heart 
It is good to see those numbers again 
The Suite Of Old Russian Dances that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical Moiseyev vigor and warmth  the amusing Yurochka in which a hard to please young man is given his come uppance  the lovely  and of course vigorous  Polyanka or The Meadow  the three Moldavian dances entitled Zhok  the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called Bul'ba  and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called City Quadrille are all just as good as one remembers them to have been and they are welcome back 
So for that matter are the newer dances  the Kalmuk Dance with its animal movements that genial juggling act by Sergei Tsvetkov called The Platter the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called Summer The Three Shepherds of Azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs and of course the trenchant Rock 'n' Roll 
As autumn starts its annual sweep few Americans and Canadians realize how fortunate they are in having the world's finest fall coloring 
Spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth 
The only other regions so blessed are the British Isles western Europe eastern China southern Chile and parts of Japan New Zealand and Tasmania 
Their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson gold purple bronze blue and vermilion that flame up in North America 
Jack Frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle  in fact a freezing autumn dulls the blaze 
The best effects come from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late summer rain followed by sunny days and cool nights 
Foliage pilgrimages either organized or individual are becoming an autumn item for more and more Americans each year 
Below is a specific guide keyed to the calendar 
Nature Canada 
Late September finds Quebec's color at its peak especially in the Laurentian hills and in the area south of the St Lawrence River 
In the Maritime provinces farther east the tones are a little quieter 
Ontario's foliage is most vivid from about Sept 23 to Oct 10 with both Muskoka  100 miles north of Toronto  and Haliburton  125 miles northwest of Toronto  holding color cavalcades starting Sept 23 
In the Canadian Rockies great groves of aspen are already glinting gold 
New England 
Vermont's sugar maples are scarlet from Sept 25 to Oct 15 and often hit a height in early October 
New Hampshire figures its peak around Columbus Day and boasts of all its hardwoods including the yellow of the birches 
The shades tend to be a little softer in the forests that blanket so much of Maine 
In western Massachusetts and northwest Connecticut the Berkshires are at their vibrant prime the first week of October 
Middle Atlantic states 
The Adirondacks blaze brightest in early October choice routes being 9*n from Saratoga up to Lake George and 73 and 86 in the Lake Placid area 
Farther south in New York there is a heavy haze of color over the Catskills in mid *october notably along routes 23 and 23*a 
About the same time the Alleghenies and Poconos in Pennsylvania are magnificent  Renovo holds its annual Flaming Foliage Festival on Oct 14 15 
New Jersey's color varies from staccato to pastel all the way from the Delaware Water Gap to Cape May 
Southeast 
During the first half of October the Blue Ridge and other parts of the Appalachians provide a spectacle stretching from Maryland and West Virginia to Georgia 
The most brilliant displays are along the Skyline Drive above Virginia's Shenandoah Valley and throughout the Great Smokies between North Carolina and Tennessee 
Midwest 
Michigan Wisconsin and Minnesota have many superb stretches of color which reach their height from the last few days of September well into October especially in their northern sections e g  Wisconsin's Vilas County whose Colorama celebration is Sept 29 *oct 8 
In Wisconsin take route 55 north of Shawano or routes 78 and 60 from Portage to Prairie Du Chien 
In Michigan there is fine color on route 27 up to the Mackinac Straits while the views around Marquette and Iron Mountain in the Upper Peninsula are spectacular 
In Minnesota Arrowhead County and route 53 north to International Falls are outstanding 
Farther south there are attractive patches all the way to the Ozarks with some seasonal peaks as late as early November 
Illinois' Shawnee National Forest Missouri's Iron County and the maples of Hiawatha Kan should be at their best in mid *october 
The West 
The Rockies have many Aspencades which are organized tours of the aspen areas with frequent stops at vantage points for viewing the golden panoramas 
In Colorado Ouray has its Fall Color Week Sept 22 29 Rye and Salida both sponsor Aspencades Sept 24 and Steamboat Springs has a week long Aspencade Sept 25 30

Americana pleasure domes 
Two sharply contrasting places designed for public enjoyment are now on display 
The Corn Palace at Mitchell S Dak  the world's corniest building has a carnival through Sept 23 headlining the Three Stooges and Pee Wee Hunt 
Since 1892 ears of red yellow purple and white corn have annually been nailed to 11 big picture panels to create huge paintings 
The 1961 theme is the Dakota Territorial Centennial with the pictures including the Lewis and Clark expedition the first river steamboat the 1876 gold rush a little red schoolhouse on the prairie and today's construction of large Missouri River reservoirs 
The panels will stay up until they are replaced next summer 
Longwood Gardens near Kennett Square Pa  about 12 miles from Wilmington Del   was developed and heavily endowed by the late Pierre S Du Pont 
Every Wednesday night through Oct 11 there will be an elaborate colored fountain display with 229 nozzles throwing jets of water up to 130 feet 
The peacock tail nozzle throws a giant fan of water 100 feet wide and 40 feet high 
The gardens themselves are open free of charge the year round and the 192 permanent employes make sure that not a dead or wilted flower is ever seen indoors or out by any visitor 
The greenhouses alone cover 3 1/2 acres

A year ago it was bruited that the primary character in Erich Maria Remarque's new novel was based on the Marquis Alfonso De Portago the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille Miglia automobile race of 1957 
If this was in fact Mr Remarque's intention he has achieved a notable failure 
Clerfayt of Heaven Has No Favorites resembles Portago only in that he is male and a race driver  quite a bad race driver whereas Portago was a good one 
He is a dull unformed and aimless person  the twelfth Marquis De Portago was intelligent purposeful and passionate 
One looked forward to Mr Remarque's ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised 
Unhappily Heaven Has No Favorites does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list 
Mr Remarque's conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble 
He proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery 
His treatment of it is something else 
His heroine chooses to die  the price of recovery years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium being higher than she wishes to pay 
Her lover precedes her in death at the wheel and presumably he too has chosen 
Between the first meeting of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement Mr Remarque has laid down many pages of junior philosophical discourse some demure and rather fetching love making pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of Europe and a modicum of automobile racing 
The ramblings on life death and the wonder of it all are distressing  the love making perhaps because it is pale and low key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness is often charming  the automobile racing bears little relation to reality 
This latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn Clerfayt as say a tournament golfer 
Hazards to life and limb on the golf course while existent are actuarially insignificant 
Race drivers on the other hand are quite often killed on the circuit and since it was obviously Mr Remarque's intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes 
He does not 
The jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver and he may indeed have been although I do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature 
Perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal 
The book carries a disclaimer in which Remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing 
The necessity is not clear to me and in any case to present a case hardened race driver as saying he has left his car which or whom he calls Giuseppe parked on the Place Vendome sneering at a dozen Bentleys and Rolls *royces parked around him is not a liberty  it is an absurdity 
But it is in the matter of preoccupation with death which is the primary concern of the book that Remarque's failure is plainest 
Clerfayt is neurotic preoccupied and passive 
To be human he believes is to seek one's own destruction  the Freudian death wish cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk about auto race drivers 
In point of fact the race drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live 
A Clerfayt may moon on about the face of Death in the cockpit  a Portago could say as he did say to me if I die tomorrow still I have had twenty eight wonderful years  but I shan't die tomorrow  I'll live to be 105 
Clerfayt transported may think of the engine driving his car as a mystical beast under the hood 
The Italian master Piero Taruffi no less sensitive knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a car's adhesion to a wet two lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae 
Clerfayt driving sees himself a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell  the Briton Stirling Moss one of the greatest virtuosi of all time believes that ultra fast road circuit driving is an art form related to ballet 
Errors in technical terminology suggest that the over all translation from the German may not convey quite everything Mr Remarque hoped to tell us 
However my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race drivers pilots submariners atomic researchers and all the machine masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists 
The west is leaderless according to this book 
In contrast the East is ably led by such stalwart heroes as Khrushchev Tito and Mao 
Against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all 
It is Field Marshal Montgomery's belief that in most Western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or Christianity  about 30 per cent call themselves Christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable and only the last 10 per cent are genuine Christians and believers in democracy 
But these Western countries do care about themselves 
Each feels intensely national 
If say the Russians intended to stop Tom Jones' going to the pub then Tom Jones would fight the Commies 
But he would fight for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connected with it  such as cause 
For all practical purposes the West stands disunited undedicated and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership 
With this barrage Montgomery of Alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the West 
Never given to mincing words he places heavy blame upon the faulty uncourageous leadership of Britain and particularly America 
At war's end leadership in Western Europe passed from Britain because the Labour Government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state 
With Britain looking inward overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the United States 
Montgomery believes that she started well 
America gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike 
She pushed wartorn and poverty stricken nations into prosperity but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace 
America has divided more than she has united the West 
The reasons are that America generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars and that she compulsively strives to be liked 
However she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed 
But the greater reason for fumbling stumbling American leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the Japanese attacked at Pearl Harbor 
They are determined Montgomery writes not to be surprised again and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary but also creates nervousness among other nations in the Western Alliance  not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the Eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible 
The net result is that under American leadership the general world situation has become bad 
To Monty the American people who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third World War 
As faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United States must be relied upon to lead 
The path to leadership is made clear 
Montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the West's own house in order 
Such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence 
This leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the United States namely that Russia will agree to a reunited Germany that the East German government does not exist that events in Japan in June 1960 were Communist inspired that the true government of China is in Formosa that Mao was the evil influence behind Khrushchev at the Summit Conference in Paris in May 1960 and that either China or Russia wants or expects war 
Such a leader must strengthen *j politically and establish that true unity about which it has always talked 
After drastically overhauling *j Western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that tear apart the East and West 
Major to this effort is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own territories say by 1970 
The West should make the central proposal  but the East would have to show sincerity in carrying it out 
But where is the leader who will handle all these things for us 
Montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of Kennedy 
The man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is De Gaulle 
He alone has the wisdom the conviction the tenacity and the courage to reach a decision 
But De Gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring France's lost soul 
Whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership 
The leader Montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself lead a carefully regulated and orderly life allow time for quiet thought and reflection adapt decisions and plans to changing situations be ruthless particularly with inefficiency and be honest and morally proper 
All in all Montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him 
In looking as far back as Moses thence to Cromwell Napoleon Lincoln Churchill and Nehru Montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men 
He believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by Churchill who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for Hitler's war 
However Montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice 
Most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene 
Like Eisenhower he holds the militarist's suspicion of politicians 
However at the same time Montgomery selects as his hero De Gaulle who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions 
Monty shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support 
For the most part his writing rambles and jogs preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts 
Nevertheless Montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the Western world 
It suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership 
And it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events 
It is no common thing for a listener  critical or otherwise  to hear a singer live for the first time only after he has died 
But then Mario Lanza was no common singer and his whole career public and non public was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first recital only when he has ceased to be a living voice 
It is a kind of justice too that it should originate in London's Royal Albert Hall where traditionally the loudest if not the greatest performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate  R*c*a Victor *j 2454 $4 98  
To be sure Lanza made numerous concert tours here and abroad but these did not take him to New York where the carping critic might lurk 
The reading public the theatergoing public the skindiving public the horse playing public  all these and others fill substantial roles in U *s life but none is so varied vast and vigilant as the eating public 
The Department of Agriculture averaged out U *s food consumption last year at 1 488 lbs per person which allowing for the 17 million Americans that John Kennedy said go to bed hungry every night means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs or more a day 
That mother hen of the weight height tables the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co  clucks that 48 million Americans are overweight 
Through previous centuries eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees and mostly toward just getting enough 
Now big forces buffet food 
For the first time in history the U *s has produced a society in which less than one tenth of the people turn out so much food that the Government's most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce 
In this same society the plain citizen can with an average of only one fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume 
Refrigeration automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage 
And in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new American interest in how what people eat affects their health 
To eat is human the nation is learning to think to survive divine 
Fads facts not all the concern for health is well directed 
From the fusty panaceas of spinach eggs and prunes the U *s has progressed to curds concentrates and capsules 
Each year reports the American Medical Association ten million Americans spend $900 million on vitamins tonics and other food supplements 
At juice bars in Los Angeles' 35 health stores a new sensation is a pink high protein cocktail concocted of dried eggs powdered milk and cherry flavored No *cal which sells for 59 cents per 8 oz glass 
Grocery stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all 
But a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health and a big group of U *s scientists wants to supply them 
The man most firmly at grips with the problem is the University of Minnesota's Physiologist Ancel Keys 57 inventor of the wartime *j  for Keys  ration and author of last year's bestselling Eat Well And Stay Well 
From his birch paneled office in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene under the university's football stadium in Minneapolis  we get a rumble on every touchdown  blocky grey haired Dr Keys directs an ambitious $200 000 a year experiment on diet which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing 
Pursuing it he has logged 500 000 miles suffered indescribable digestive indignities and meticulously collected physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10 000 individuals from Bantu tribesmen to Italian contadini 
He has measured the skinfolds  the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades  of Neapolitan firemen studied the metabolism of Finnish woodcutters analyzed the mealie meal eaten by Capetown coloreds and experimented on Minneapolis businessmen 
And fats 
Keys's findings though far from complete are likely to smash many an eating cliche 
Vitamins eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on  though mothers' milk is still the ticket  
Readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood which seem to have value in predicting heart attacks are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack 
Already many an American knows his count and rejoices or worries depending on whether it is nearer 180  safe  or 250  dangerous  
Out of cholesterol come Keys's main messages so far  Americans eat too much 
The typical U *s daily menu says Dr Keys contains 3 000 calories should contain 2 300 
And extra weight increases the risk of cancer diabetes artery disease and heart attack 
Americans eat too much fat 
With meat milk butter and ice cream the calorie heavy U *s diet is 40% fat and most of that is saturated fat  the insidious kind says Dr Keys that increases blood cholesterol damages arteries and leads to coronary disease 
Obesity  a malnutrition 
Throughout much of the world food is still so scarce that half of the earth's population has trouble getting the 1 600 calories a day necessary to sustain life 
The deficiency diseases  scurvy tropical sprue pellagra  run rampant 
In West Africa for example where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals a childhood menace is kwashiorkor or Red Johnny a growth stunting protein deficiency  signs  reddish hair bloated belly  that kills more than half its victims leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease 
In the well fed U *s  deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years 
Today as Harrison's Principles Of Internal Medicine a standard internist's text puts it the most common form of malnutrition is caloric excess or obesity 
Puritan New England regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance and thus a sin 
Says Keys  maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral the fat man would start to think 
Morals aside the fat man has plenty to worry about  over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him 
The simple mechanical strain of overweight says New York's Dr Norman Jolliffe can overburden and damage the heart for much the same reason that a Chevrolet engine in a Cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built 
The fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher premiums 
He has  for unclear reasons  a 25% higher death rate from cancer 
He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes 
He may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable because excess body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement 
Physiologically people overeat because what Dr Jolliffe calls the appestat is set too high 
The appestat which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant is located says Jolliffe in the hypothalamus  near the body's temperature sleep and water balance controls 
Physical exercise raises the appestat 
So does cold weather 
In moderate doses alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances appetite  the original reason for the cocktail   but because liquor has a high caloric value  100 calories per oz   the heavy drinker is seldom hungry 
In rare cases diseases such as encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently destroying nearly all sense of satiety 
Food for frustration 
Far more frequently overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion 
It may be fostered by frustration depression insecurity  or in children simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging 
Some families place undue emphasis on food  conversations center on it and rich delicacies are offered as rewards withheld as punishment 
The result says Jolliffe  the child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life 
Food may act as a sedative giving temporary emotional solace just as for some people alcohol does 
Reports Dr Keys  a fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more 
He may be interested in another woman or just like being with the boys 
So she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake 
It's a matter of boredom and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something because she's being deprived of something else 
For the army of compulsive eaters  from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons  reducing is a war with the will that is rarely won 
Physiologist Keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as the amphetamines  Benzedrine Dexedrine  as dangerous crutches for a weak will 
Keys has no such objections to Metrecal Quaker Oats's Quota and other 900 calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters 
Metrecal is a pretty complete food he says 
It contains large amounts of protein vitamins and minerals 
In the quantity of 900 calories a day anyone will lose weight on it  20 30 or 40 lbs 
But Keys worries that the Metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food 
That remarkable cholesterol 
Despite his personal distaste for obesity  disgusting  Dr Keys has only an incidental interest in how much Americans eat 
What concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation's No 1 killer  coronary artery disease which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500 000 Americans a year  twice the toll from all varieties of cancer five times the deaths from automobile accidents 
Cholesterol the cornerstone of Dr Keys's theory is a mysterious yellowish waxy substance chemically a crystalline alcohol 
Scientists assume that cholesterol  from the Greek chole meaning bile and sterios meaning solid  is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells since it accounts for about 2% of the brain's total solid weight 
They know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones 
They suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system 
But they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver 
Although the fatty protein molecules carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol are water soluble cholesterol itself is insoluble and cannot be destroyed by the body 
A remarkable substance says Dr Keys quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries 
When thus deposited Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks 
Explains Keys  as the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream they are deposited in the intima or inner wall of a coronary artery 
The proteins and fats are burned off and the cholesterol is left behind 
As cholesterol piles up it narrows irritates and damages the artery encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation 
Eventually says Keys one of two things happens 
A clot forms at the site seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart attack 
Or  more commonly thinks Keys  the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the point that an infarct occurs  the heart muscle is suffocated cells supplied by the artery die and the heart is permanently perhaps fatally injured 
Fats & coronaries 
Ordinarily the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body's needs  for transportation of fats and for production of bile 
Even eggs and other cholesterol rich foods eaten in normal amounts says Dr Keys do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood 
But fatty foods do 
During World War 2 doctors in The Netherlands and Scandinavia noted a curious fact  despite the stresses of Nazi occupation the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping 
Not until long after the war  1950 in fact  did they get a hint of the reason 
That year Sweden's Haqvin Malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods 
That same year the University of California's Dr Laurance Kinsell timing oxidation rates of blood fats stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically while animal fats cause them to rise 
Here Keys and others such as Dr A E Ahrens of the Rockefeller Institute took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats  and even between different varieties of each 
All natural food fats fall into one of three categories  saturated mono unsaturated and poly unsaturated 
The degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat molecule 
Saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens 
Mono unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule and the poly unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens 
The three fats have similar caloric values  about 265 calories per oz   but each exerts a radically different influence on blood cholesterol 
As a result although we still make use of this distinction there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed 
Just what is meant by spirit and by matter 
The terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all 
Yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do 
For in the modern world neither spirit nor matter refer to any generally agreed upon elements of experience 
We are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected 
When the words are used we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours 
One of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit 
Just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities 
Not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true 
Demons fairies angels and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars 
In such a world the words matter and spirit both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all 
In it important elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in general which now cause us much difficulty could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously 
The progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it 
In carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit 
The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support 
Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time 
When therefore it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality 
In doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions 
There have been indeed many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful 
All this has not however been an unmixed blessing 
The scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough 
The house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means or at best with wholly inadequate means for dealing with his experience of spirit 
Although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever 
We simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience 
There is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality as we know and apprehend it with respect to which we can refer this experience 
Science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives 
The situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in Arthur Miller's play The Crucible which deals with the Salem witch trials 
As the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of Salem in Puritan America at the end of the eighteenth century 
Aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene it is a quite normal community 
The conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures foibles irritations and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age 
There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people 
Instead the audience can sit back at ease and from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion 
A teenage girl Abigail Williams is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle the Reverend Samuel Parris about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings 
For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night the demon world is populated with real creatures and witches actually can be seen flying through the air 
As the play unfolds however the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community 
Everyone in Salem saint and sinner alike is swept up by it 
It is like a mysterious epidemic which starting first with Abigail and Parris spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it 
It grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery moral disintegration and destruction 
The audience leaves the play under a spell it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes 
If one asks about this play what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power there is no better answer to give than spirit 
This is not to attempt to say what spirit is but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience 
In the end the good man John Proctor expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says a fire a fire is burning ] I hear the boot of Lucifer I see his filthy face ] the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them 
We marvel at their blindness for not seeing this 
Yet are not we of the mid twentieth century who rightly do not believe there is any such thing as the devil just as bad off as they  only in a different way 
In our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play 
We are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false 
Even Mr Miller himself seems uncertain on this score 
In a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play he says at one point  however that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of Lucifer's many faced lieutenants 
And his belief is not to his discredit 
Better minds than Hale's were  and still are  convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken 
 page 33  on the other hand a little later on he says  since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out God's beard and the Devil's horns but the world is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes 
The concept of unity in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force in which good and evil are relative ever changing and always joined to the same phenomenon  such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas 
When we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man's worthlessness  until redeemed  the necessity of the Devil may become evident as a weapon a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church state 
 page 34  apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real 
Yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over Salem 
It casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power 
It is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect 
For this does not account for the integral elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell 
The reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions to the contrary 
Spirit and community there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit 
Apart from spirit there could be no community for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity cohesiveness and permanence 
Think for example of the spirit of the Marine Corps 
Surely this is a reality we all acknowledge 
We cannot of course assign it any substance 
It is not material and is not a thing occupying space and time 
Yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known 
So it is too with many other spirits which we all know  the spirit of Nazism or Communism school spirit the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team the spirit of Rotary or the Ku Klux Klan 
Every community if it is alive has a spirit and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity 
In searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful 
For it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit 
It is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere 
It is the spirit which is the source of a community's drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers 
Yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community 
The idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas 
One characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness 
The members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them 
It is for them a given which they and they alone possess 
The spirit of the Marine Corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it 
It is they of course who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the Corps for future recruits to find as they come into it 
If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be understanded of the people  and this it must not be forgotten is one of the goals of the perennial theological task  there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation 
This does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching 
The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention 
His point is not that mythology may not be used but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma 
When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence 
Mythological concepts may by all means still be used but they can be used responsibly only as symbols or ciphers that is only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological  or existential  terms 
The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues in this way he overestimates the intellectual stumbling block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the Christian faith 
But this statement is completely unconvincing 
If Bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to  and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements  the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant 
Nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated 
On the contrary even in the heart of the Bible belt itself as can be attested by any one who is called to work there the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself and his world 
In fact it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed 
Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence 
This is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class 
Time and again in counseling and teaching one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their fundamentalist heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious 
The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme culture *protestantism so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches 
In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand  and this usually means one or another of the various forms of folk religion current in the situation 
This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent Peale's cult of reassurance or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever present need for a demythologized gospel 
But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected 
However even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace 
To be sure when this is pointed out a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about the little flock and the great crowd and to take solace from Paul's castigation of the wisdom of the wise in the opening chapter of First Corinthians 
But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation 
Can the church risk assuming that the folly of men is as dear to God as their wisdom or as is also commonly implied that the foolishness of God and the foolishness of men are simply two ways of talking about the same thing 
Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious 
There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church  which derives however from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible  that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world 
By analogy the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the world in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church 
But as Scripture everywhere reminds us God does have need of his creatures and the church a fortiori can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world by God's providence presents it 
And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume as we too often do that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men 
Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends 
In arguing in this way we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved  and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction 
But the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable 
This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition 
If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no or where I do not have the right to say anything at all then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian 
Expressed differently  if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus Christ is some form of self destruction whether of the body or of the mind  sacrificium corporis sacrificium intellectus  then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid 
This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter 
Modern man as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us has come of age  and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is in fact marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation it is still a positive step forward  and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it 
In any event it is an irreversible step and if we are at all honest with ourselves we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen fit to place us 
To say this of course is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years or at any rate since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought 
We have aligned ourselves with that liberal tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher Ritschl Herrmann Harnack and Troeltsch and more recently Schweitzer and the early Barth and in part at least Bultmann 
It is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong 
For we must number here not only the names of Bushnell Clarke and Rauschenbusch not to mention those of the Chicago School and Macintosh but those of the brothers Niebuhr and  if America may claim him ]  Tillich as well 
Finally we may also mention the several members of the self consciously neoliberal movement that developed at the University of Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred North Whitehead 
What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world 
Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity 
They have insisted rather on living fully and completely within modern culture and so far from considering this treason to God have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him 
When we say then that today in our situation the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement 
However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's constructive formulations the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism not behind it 
In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann's attempt to formulate such a theology has led 
For we have said in effect that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion only one is really an alternative 
If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally the position of the right is clearly untenable 
Whereas Bultmann's center position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone the general position of the right as represented say by Karl Barth involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered 
It follows then provided the possibilities have been exhausted that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the left which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz Buri and to some extent at least is found in much that is significant in American and English theology 
In order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible we may develop this argument at greater length 
We may show first that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by Bultmann Barth and Buri 
To do this it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two then the question of a third possibility is a meaningless question 
Thus if what is at issue is whether all *j is *j it is indifferent whether some *j is not *j or no *j is *j since in either case the judgment in question is false 
Hence if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted  for in either event the first possibility is excluded 
Therefore the only conceivable alternatives are those represented on the one hand by the two at least apparently self consistent but mutually exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and on the other hand by the third but really pseudo position  analogous to a round square  of Bultmann 
A second point requires more extended comment 
It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the right as represented by Barth rests on the following thesis  the only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that  1  rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation   2  accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation  and  3  in so doing frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that from Bultmann's point of view are mythological 
One hundred years ago there existed in England the Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom 
Representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the Roman and Anglican Churches and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to Rome this association produced little fruit and in fact was condemned by the Holy Office in 1864 
Now again in 1961 in England there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as Christian unity 
The Church Unity Octave January 18 25 was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches 
Many people seem hopeful yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861 
But it must be readily seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope at least on the Catholic side 
For the tide is well on the turn as the London Catholic weekly Universe has written 
I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal Newman 
As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry I came with certain preconceptions and expectations  being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th century literature of England I knew only a Protestant dominated country 
Since arriving here however I have formed a far different religious picture of present day England 
In representing part of this new picture I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences reactions and judgments  but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican Churches and about the present religious state of England 
Since the Protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit my Roman collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman Catholic cleric 
In any case I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by Englishmen even in Devonshire and Cornwall where anti *catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest 
Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti *catholicism 
On my first Guy Fawkes Day here I found Catholics as well as non *catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires and was told that most Englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day 
A Birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled The True Story of Guy Fawkes which began  when you pile your guy on the bonfire tomorrow night I wonder how much of the true story of Guy Fawkes you will remember 
In the 355 years since the first Guy Fawkes Night much of the story has been forgotten so here is a reminder 
The article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a Catholic plot to kill King James 1 
In spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840's and 1850's the Catholic segment of England one hundred years ago was a very small one  four per cent or 800 000  which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public 
The return of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and in fact was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty 
In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers 
Now in 1961 the Catholic population of England is still quite small  ten per cent or 5 million   yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population 
A Protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the Birmingham Oratory  Catholic  Church on Sunday mornings 
She found this a marvel because as she said only six per cent of English people are churchgoers 
She may not have been exact on this number but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten 
From many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services 
A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university following Anglican evensong at which there was a congregation of twelve he celebrated Mass before more than a hundred 
The Protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches 
According to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church of England the total of confirmed members is 9 748 000 but only 2 887 671 are registered on the parochial church rolls and over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church of England but roughly only a tenth of them continue 
An amazing article in the Manchester Guardian of last November entitled Fate Of Redundant Churches states than an Archbishops' Commission reported last month that in the Church of England alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now or will be in 20 years' time 
A further 260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 
And in the last five years the Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or more often the sale of 764 chapels 
Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses but neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman Catholics and have done so 
While it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period and that religious population shifts have emptied churches a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going to church 
It should be admitted too that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics  one paper writes 50 per cent  
Still it is clear from such reports and apparently clear from the remarks of many people that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing 
An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true 
A century ago Newman saw that liberalism  what we now might call secularism  would gradually but definitely make its mark on English Protestantism and that even high Anglicanism would someday no longer be a serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own 
That day is perhaps today 1961 and it seems no longer very meaningful to call England a Protestant country 
One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not relatively speaking many real Christians to unite 
Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy 
The London Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping out various aspects of Catholic progress during the last one hundred years 
With traditional nationalistic spirit some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism at its best 
I have found myself saying with other foreigners here that English Catholics are good Catholics 
It has been my experience to find as many men as women in church and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses at Mass 
They hope of course to reclaim the non *catholic population to the Catholic faith and at every Sunday Benediction they recite by heart the Prayer for England  o Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of God and our most gentle queen and mother look down in mercy upon England thy dowry and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee 
Intercede for our separated brethren that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief Shepherd the vicar of thy Son 
A hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is Faith Of Our Fathers which glories in England's ancient faith that endured persecution and which proclaims  faith of our Fathers  Mary's prayers shall win our country back to thee 
The English saints are widely venerated quite naturally and now there is great hope that the Forty Martyrs and Cardinal Newman will soon be canonized 
Because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers English Catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being un *english 
I have not seen this charge made during my stay here but apparently it is still in the air 
For example a writer in a recent number of the Queen hyperbolically states that of the myriad imprecations the only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are un *english 
In this connection it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics priests and laity in England while certainly seen as good for Catholicism is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good 
One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid 19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities 
At Oxford one hundred years ago there were very few Catholics partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 
Moreover for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs 
Now not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non *catholic members of the University 
Some Catholic priests lecture there  Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non *catholic students 
Further evidence that Roman Catholicism enjoys a more favorable position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it in the mass media of England 
The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic Church is now at least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches 
On successive Sundays during October 1960 Paul Ferris  a non *catholic  wrote articles in the Observer depicting clergymen of the Church of England the Church of Rome and the Nonconformist Church 
The Catholic priest though somewhat superficially drawn easily came out the best 
There were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman 
Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid *victorian England 
There was so much interest shown in this present day venture that it was continued on B *b *c  where comments were equally made by an Anglican parson a Free Church minister and a Catholic priest 
Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen 
A notable example of this was the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool Dr Heenan and the Anglican Archbishop of York Dr Ramsey recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury 
The good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in England 
The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months 
And it was interesting to observe that B *b *c 's television film on Christmas Eve was The Bells Of St Mary's 
Of course the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr Fisher then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury to the Vatican last December 
It was the first time an English Primate has done this since the 14th century 
English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope 
Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England  statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants  news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit  a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non *catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters  the startling statement in a respectable periodical that Catholics if the present system is still in operation will constitute almost one third of the House of Lords in the next generation  a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave 
The death of a man is unique and yet it is universal 
The straight line would symbolize its uniqueness the circle its universality 
But how can one figure symbolize both 
Christianity declares that in the life and death of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal concur 
Perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly or formulated it as precisely as Irenaeus 
To be the Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own  he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with man's history 
Yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind 
His history is his alone yet each man must recognize his own history in it 
His death is his alone yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of Jesus 
Each man can identify himself with the history and the death of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ has identified himself with human history and human death coming as the head of a new humanity 
Not a circle then nor a straight line but a spiral represents the shape of death as Irenaeus sees it  for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence 
As represented by a spiral history may in some sense be said to repeat itself  yet each historical event remains unique 
Christ is both unique and universal 
The first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam 
As Origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of Christ 
Whence then comes the substance of the first man 
From God's Will and Wisdom and from virgin earth 
For God had not rained says the Scripture before man was made and there was no man to till the earth 
From this earth then while it was still virgin God took dust and fashioned the man the beginning of humanity 
Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve merely as private individuals but as universal human beings who were and are all of humanity 
Adam and Eve were perfect not in the sense that they possessed perfection but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection 
They were in fact children 
Irenaeus does not claim pre existence for the human soul  therefore there is no need for him as there is for Origen to identify existence itself with the fall 
Existence is created and willed by God and is not the consequence of a pre existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history 
Historical existence is a created good 
The biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words  so God created man in his own image  in the similitude of God he created him 
There are some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where the image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished so most notably in the statement  if the  Holy  Spirit is absent from the soul such a man is indeed of an animal nature  and being left carnal he will be an imperfect being possessing the image  of God  in his formation but not receiving the similitude  of God  through the Spirit 
Thus the image of God is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster  the similitude of God by contrast is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature 
Recent research on Irenaeus however makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction 
He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall  for he was created not exactly immortal nor yet exactly mortal but capable of immortality as well as of mortality 
Therefore Irenaeus describes man's creation as follows  so that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur and become lifted up as if he had no lord because of the dominion that had been given to him and the freedom fall into sin against God his Creator overstepping his bounds and take up an attitude of self conceited arrogance towards God a law was given him by God that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all 
And He laid down for him certain conditions  so that if he kept the command of God then he would always remain as he was that is immortal  but if he did not he would become mortal melting into earth whence his frame had been taken 
These conditions man did not keep and thus he became mortal  yet he did not stop being human as a result 
There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God  humanity  and the similitude of God  immortality  
Man was created with the capacity for immortality but the devil's promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality 
He was in the words of Irenaeus beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality 
The true way to immortality lay through obedience but man did not believe this 
Eve was disobedient  for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin 
And even as she having indeed a husband Adam but being nevertheless as yet a virgin having become disobedient was made the cause of death both to herself and to the entire human race  so also did Mary having a man betrothed  to her  and being nevertheless a virgin by yielding obedience become the cause of salvation both to herself and the whole human race 
Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being due no doubt to carelessness but still wicked 
His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary 
That parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too  for as it was Christ the Word of God who came to rescue man so it was disobedience to the word of God in the beginning that brought death into the world and all our woe 
With this act of disobedience and not with the inception of his individual existence man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality 
At the nadir of that circuit is death 
Along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death because they did eat in disobedience  and disobedience to God entails death 
Wherefore as they became forfeit to death from that  moment  they were handed over to it 
This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed namely on a Friday as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good Friday  he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath 
In any case though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree they obtained mortality instead 
The wages of sin is death 
Man's life originally shaped for immortality and for communion with God must now be conformed to the shape of death 
Nevertheless even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God and he still rules 
Even death therefore has a providential as well as a punitive function 
Wherefore also He  God  drove him  man  out of Paradise and removed him far from the tree of life not because He envied him the tree of life as some venture to assert but because He pitied him  and did not desire  that he should continue a sinner for ever nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal and evil interminable and irremediable 
But He set a bound to his  state of  sin by interposing death and thus causing sin to cease putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh which should take place in the earth so that man ceasing at length to live in sin and dying to it might live to God 
This idea which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology  for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ 
As man can live only by dying so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life 
It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is 
This applies to his picture of Adam 
It is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next 
It becomes most evident in his description of Christ as the second Adam who does indeed come to destroy sin but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality 
This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians especially the Greek speaking ones 
They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility which can mean  though it does not have to mean  deliverance from time and history 
Death reminds man of his sin but it reminds him also of his transience 
It represents a punishment that he knows he deserves but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time 
These two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated but they dare not be confused or identified 
The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated 
Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older in short whether Adam's life was intended to be part of the process of time 
If it was then it must have been God's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity 
One night so some of these theories run Adam would have fallen asleep much as he fell asleep for the creation of Eve  and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal 
The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change 
On the other hand Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence 
It is the wages of sin and its sting is the law 
If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator 
This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced 
If death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share the gift of the life eternal through Christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal i e  created existence 
Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation  for it teaches salvation from not salvation in time and history 
Because Christianity teaches not only salvation in history but salvation by the history of Christ such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the Christian understanding of the work of Christ 
Furthermore as an encouragement to revisionist thinking it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes 
The Unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen  as the term was then understood in the Back Bay  and Parker was definitely not a gentleman either in theology or in manners 
Ezra Stiles Gannett an honorable representative of the sanhedrin addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist 
Even so Gannett judiciously argued the Association could legitimately decide that Parker should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness 
We today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations 
One can even argue  though this is a delicate matter  that every justification existed for their returning the Public Lecture to the First Church and so to suppress it rather than let Parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it 
Finally it did seem clear as day to these clergymen as Gannett's son explained in the biography of his father they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of Christians 
Their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow free inquiry to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a natural religion 
Grant all this  still when modern Unitarianism and the Harvard Divinity School recall with humorous affection the insults Parker lavished upon them or else argue that after all Parker received the treatment he invited they betray an uneasy conscience 
Whenever New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of Parker and the fraternity on January 23 1843  while it may defend the privilege of Chandler Robbins to demand that Parker leave the Association while it may plead that Dr N L Frothingham had every warrant for stating the difference between Trinitarians and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity  the difference between Mr Parker and the Association is a difference between no Christianity and Christianity  despite these supposed conclusive assurances the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief of positive thanksgiving that the Association never quite brought itself officially to expel Parker 
Had it done so the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible nor could the Harvard Divinity School assemble today to honor Parker's insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying peccavi 
Happily for posterity then the Boston Association did not actually command Parker to leave the room though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality 
Fortunately the honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol defended Parker's sincerity as did also Gannett and Chandler Robbins  whereupon Parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room though not out of the Fellowship 
In the hall after adjournment Dr Frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested Parker to visit him  whereupon our burly Theodore again burst into tears 
All this near tragedy which to us borders on comedy enables us to tell the story over and over again always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency 
It was indeed a near thing but somehow the inherent decency of New England  which we inherit  did triumph 
Parker was never excommunicated 
To the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it 
Yet even after all these stratagems the conscience of Christian liberality is still not laid to rest any more than is the conscience of Harvard University for having done the abject penance for its rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him 
In both cases the stubborn fact remains  liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates both legitimate offspring of its loins and when brought to the test it behaved shabbily 
Suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel  is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion 
Is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about 
However there is a crucial difference between the two histories 
Emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside or rather by leaving it behind him  he walked out of the Unitarian communion so that it could lick the wound of his departure preserve its self respect and eventually accord him pious veneration 
Parker insisted upon not resigning even when the majority wanted him to depart upon daring the Fellowship to throw him out 
Hence he was in his lifetime as is the memory of him afterwards a canker within the liberal sensitivity 
He still points an accusing finger at all of us telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat 
Actually the dispute between Parker and the society of his time both ecclesiastical and social was a real one a bitter one 
It cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him 
The fact is incontestable  that liberal world of Unitarian Boston was narrow minded intellectually sterile smug afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened 
Parker along with Garrison and Charles Sumner showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized in defense of the Mexican War and slavery 
Nevertheless we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace  their passions were genuine and the division between them and the abolitionists is clear cut 
But Parker as the ultra liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom 
Even though his theological theses have become to us commonplaces the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us 
It has been endlessly rephrased but I may here put it thus  at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant 
And then as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience what do they to their dismay learn for the first time about themselves 
There can be no doubt the Boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior 
The gentle Channing revered by all Bostonians orthodox or Unitarian wrote to a friend in Louisville that among its many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action  no city in the world is governed so little by a police and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment 
We stand more in awe of one another than most people 
Opinion is less individual or runs more into masses and often rules with a rod of iron 
Even more poignantly and with the insight of a genius Channing added  remember this is Channing not Parker ]  that should a minister in Boston trust himself to his heart should he speak without book and consequently break some law of speech or be hurried into some daring hyperbole he should find little mercy 
Channing wrote this  in a letter ] I think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons 
But Theodore Parker commencing his mission to the world at large disguised as the minister of a twenty eighth Congregational Church which bore no resemblance to the Congregational polities descended from the founders  among which were still the Unitarian churches  made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the Hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum 
Because he spoke openly with what Channing had prophesied someone might  with daring hyperbole  Parker vindicated Channing's further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines 
An institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution and only within those defined limits a license 
By reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation we should I am sure come to a fresh realization however painful it be that the battle between Parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest 
He arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with at the least resentment 
What otherwise could the lawyer doctor minister the men of science and letters do when told that they had become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant and continually cried holy holy holy is the Almighty Dollar 
Nor when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old Puritan stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of rage as Parker snarled at them thus  talk about the Catholics voting as the bishop tells ] reproach the Catholics for it ] you and I do the same thing 
There are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom nor a mitre on their head who appeal not to the authority of the Pope at Rome but to the Almighty Dollar a pope much nearer home 
Boston has been controlled by a few capitalists lawyers and other managers who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think 
This was war 
Parker meant business 
And he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them  even the Unitarian churches have caught the malaria and are worse than those who deceived them  which implied that they were very bad indeed 
It was duty he said that his parents had given him as a rule  beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied  and it was duty he would perform though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty 
Parker could weep  and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation  but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents 
If it gave me pleasure to say hard things he wrote I would shut up forever 
We have to tell ourselves that when Parker spoke in this vein he believed what he said because he could continue but the truth which cost me bitter tears to say I must speak though it cost other tears hotter than fire 
Because he copiously shed his own tears and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of New England he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's consciences 
Our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very issue which in the Boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its Christian survival that of the literal factual historicity of the miracles as reported in the Four Gospels 
It is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody professing the deepest piety decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not Christ transformed the water into wine at eleven A *m on the third of August A *d 32 
We have no answer as to why we are not alarmed 
So we are the more prepared to give Parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy to salute his courage and to pass on happily forgetting both him and the entire episode 
We have not the leisure or the patience or the skill to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the Harvard Divinity School who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor the majesterial Andrews Norton by saying that while he believed Jesus like other religious teachers worked miracles I see not how a miracle proves a doctrine 
I have within the past fifty years come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the Truth and about which I have not a shadow of doubt 
It has been my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions the nature of the hope of a life beyond this 
I have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world 
In an amateurish yet in a very real sense I have followed the developments of archaeology geology astronomy herpetology and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being made in these fields 
At one time I became disturbed in the faith in which I had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon both Old and New Testaments by a Higher Criticism of the Bible to refute which I felt the need of a better knowledge of Hebrew and of archaeology for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure 
Doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and like some higher critical friends trying to continue to use the Bible as the Word of God while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations  attempting to bridge the chasm between an older reverent Bible loving generation and a critical doubting Bible emancipated race 
Although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the Book I stood outside shivering in the cold 
In one thing the higher critics like the modernists however overreached themselves in claiming that the Gospel of John was not written in John's time but well after the first century perhaps as late as 150 A *d 
Now if any part of the Bible is assuredly the very Word of God speaking through His servant it is John's Gospel 
To ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower and was not inspired directly by the Spirit of God is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the Bible 
Here I took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path to which we might give the modern name of Pragmatism or the thing that works 
Test it try it and if it works accept it as a guiding principle 
So I put my Bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself and then tested it to see how it worked 
As a short possibly not the best method I looked up Word in the Concordance and noted that the Bible claims from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 to be God's personal message to man 
The next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the Christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly science and I submitted to its conditions according to Christ's invitation and promise that if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself  John 7  17  
The outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the Bible as the Word of God inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book and with it the acceptance of our Lord Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God Son of Man by the Virgin Mary the Saviour of the world 
I believe therefore that we are without exception sinners by nature alienated from God and that Jesus Christ the Son of God came to earth the representative Head of a new race to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world and that he who thus receives Christ as his personal Saviour is born again spiritually with new privileges appetites and affections destined to live and grow in His likeness forever 
Nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable moral life although such works are the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such avenues 
I now ever look for Christ according to His promises and those of the Old Testament as well to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth 
To state fully what the Bible means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and friends 
The Bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body 
Again as faith reveals God my Father and Christ my Saviour I follow without question where He leads me daily by His Spirit of love wisdom power and prayer 
I place His precepts and His leadings above every seeming probability dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed to Him 
I discern no limits to a faith vested in God and Christ who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge and daring to trust Him even though called to stand alone before the world 
Our Lord's invitation with its implied promise to all is come and see 
I stood at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld a very sick man in terrible pain 
As I ministered to his needs I noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and I learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the Lord 
In his heart he had that peace of which the Lord spoke when He said peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you  not as the world giveth give I unto you 
Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid 
What a joy to realize that we too can claim this promise tendered by the Lord during His earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to Him 
He was about to leave them to depart from this world and return to His Father in Heaven 
Before He left them He promised that His peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts and minds 
I praise God for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ 
It makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the Lord's guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients 
How often have I looked to Jesus when entering the sick room asking for His presence and help in my professional duties as I give my talents not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the Saviour and His creatures 
Looking unto God the Prophet Isaiah wrote these blessed words almost three thousand years ago  thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee  because he trusteth in thee 
Are you longing for peace in your heart 
Such a calm and assuring peace can be yours 
As only a member of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family likewise one must belong to the family of God in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are His own 
Perhaps you are not His child 
Perhaps you do not know if you belong to Him 
You may know that you are in God's family and be just as sure of it as you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father 
God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and as many as received him to them gave He power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on His name 
It is to those who believe on His name and belong to Him that He gives His peace  not that empty peace the world offers but a deep abiding peace which nothing can destroy 
Why not open your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ now accept Him as your Saviour and let Him fill you with peace that only He can give 
Then with the hymn writer of old you can say  I am resting today in His wonderful peace resting sweetly in Jesus' control 
I am kept from all danger by night and by day and His glory is flooding my soul 
Satellites sputniks rockets balloons  what next 
Our necks are stiff from gazing at the wonders of outer space which have captured the imagination of the American public 
Cape Canaveral's achievements thunder forth from the radio television and newspaper 
While we are filling outer space with scientific successes for many the inner space of their soul is an aching void 
Proof 
An average of 50 suicides are reported in America each day ] one out of every three or four marriages ends in divorce ] over $200 000 000 is paid yearly to the 80 000 full time fortune tellers in the United States by fearful mankind who want to know what the future holds ] delinquency juvenile and adult is at an all time high ] further proof 
Read your daily newspaper ] unfortunately in our rush to beat the Russians we have forgotten these truth packed words of Jesus Christ  what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world  that includes outer space  and lose his own soul 
Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul 
 Mark 36 37  
Gaining outer space and losing inner space is bad business according to God's standards 
It is true that we must keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments  only a fool would think otherwise 
But we must not forget man's soul 
Is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news that God put His Son Jesus Christ on earth to live and die to save our hell bound souls 
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life  John 3  16  
Never forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link 
Your spiritual inner space helps determine the spirituality of America as a nation 
We trust you are not one of the 70 000 000 Americans who do not attend church but who feel that various forms of recreation are more important than worshipping the God who made our country great 
Is forgiveness of past sins assurance of present help and hope of future bliss in your orbit 
Or are you trying the devil's substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within 
Pleasure fame and fortune drowning your troubles with a drink and living it up with the gang are like candy bars when you're hungry  they may ease your hunger temporarily but they'll never take the place of a satisfying mouth watering steak 
So it is spiritually 
No amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will relieve the gnawing of your inner space 
Why 
Because your soul was made to be filled with God Himself not religious functions about Him 
Only He can satisfy the deepest longings 
That is why the Bible commands you to taste and see that the Lord is good  blessed  happy  is the man that trusteth in Him  Psalm 34  8  
You can receive God into your heart and life by a step of personal faith 
Accept the sinless Son of God Jesus Christ as your own personal Saviour 
As many as received Him  Jesus  to them gave He power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name 
The Lord is my light and my salvation  whom shall I fear 
The Lord is the strength of my life  of whom shall I be afraid 
 Psalm 27  1  a certain teacher scheduled a Fear Party for her fourth grade pupils 
It was a session at which all the youngsters were told to express their fears to get them out in the open where they could talk about them freely 
The teacher thought it was so successful that she asks  wouldn't it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries 
Dr George W Crane a medical columnist thinks it would 
He says  that would reduce neurotic ailments tremendously 
Each week an estimated 20 million patients call upon us doctors 
Of this number 50% or 10 million patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever 
They are worry warts 
Yet they keep running from one physician to another largely to get a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles 
One of the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions 
We are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days 
It must be getting more serious 
People are giving their doctors a hard time 
One doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles and he reported that 40% of them worried about things that never happened  30% of them worried about past happenings which were completely beyond their control  12% of them worried about their health although their ailments were imaginary  10% of them worried about their friends neighbors and relatives most of whom were quite capable of taking care of themselves 
Only 8% of the worries had behind them real causes which demanded attention 
Well most of our fears may be unfounded but after you discover that fact you have something else to worry about  why then do we have these fears 
What is the real cause of them 
What is there about us that makes us so anxious 
Look at the things we do to escape our fears and to forget our worries 
We spend millions of dollars every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers 
We spend billions of dollars at the race tracks and more billions on other forms of gambling 
We spend billions of dollars on liquor and many more billions on various forms of escapist entertainment 
We consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get a moment's relief from the tensions that are tearing us apart 
A visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks and after he had seen it all he said to a friend  you must be a very sad people 
Sad was not the right word of course 
He should have said jittery for that's what we are 
And that's worse than sad 
Watch people flock to amusement houses cocktail lounges and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation  watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something 
In one of his writings Pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates 
Yes and as tension mounts in this world fear is increasing 
Does that explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business 
We have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate 
I doubt that fear parties and group confessionals will help very much 
Suppose we do get our fears out in the open what then 
Isn't that where most of them are already  right out on the front page of our newspapers 
Maybe we are talking about them too much 
The question is  what are we going to do about them 
Meanwhile the enemy will capitalize on our fears if he can 
Hitler did just that 23 years ago building up tensions that first led to a Munich and then to a world war 
The fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate 
It is said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals to attack 
It could have the same effect on Communists 
The President of the United States has said  we will never negotiate out of fear and we will never fear to negotiate 
That is a sound position but it is important that Moscow shall recognize it not merely as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not afraid 
And that's another reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer our fears to develop the poise that promotes peace 
Turning to the Word of God we find the only sure way to do that 
In Psalm 27  1 you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you or to drive them out if they have you in their grip  the Lord is my light and my salvation  whom shall I fear 
The Lord is the strength of my life  of whom shall I be afraid 
Well you say those are beautiful words all right but it was easy for the psalmist to sing them in his day 
He didn't live in a world of perpetual peril like ours 
He didn't know anything about the problems we face today 
No 
Read the next two verses  when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell 
Though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear  though war should rise against me in this will I be confident 
That is almost a perfect description of the predicament in which we find ourselves today isn't it 
Our enemy is also threatening to devour us 
He has already devoured huge areas of the world putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains and barbed wire reducing them to slavery systematically crushing not only their bodies but their souls and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison 
Yes indeed we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us 
What a terrible thing that wailing wall in Berlin ] a man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family 
Another man tried to swim across the river from the East to the West but was shot and killed 
A middle aged woman opened a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall she threw out a few belongings and then jumped  she was fatally injured 
The entrance to a church has been walled up so that the congregation most of which is in the western sector cannot worship God there anymore 
Practically everybody in Berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city 
People stand at the wall giving vent to their feelings weeping pounding it with their fists pleading for loved ones 
But the enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out Communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity 
There is only one escape left a tragic one and too many people are taking it  suicide 
The normal rate of suicides in East Berlin was one a day but since the border was closed on August 13 it has jumped to 25 a day ] these things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door 
We are all involved in them deeply involved 
And nobody knows what comes next 
We live from crisis to crisis 
And there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world 
He must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world  the Lord is my light and my salvation  whom shall I fear 
The Lord is the strength of my life  of whom shall I be afraid 
Notice that this man had a threefold conception of God which is the secret of his faith 
First the Lord is my light 
He lived in a very dark world but he was not in the dark 
The same God who called this world into being when He said  let there be light ]  those were His very first creative words  He began the world with light  this God still gives light to a world which man has plunged into darkness 
For those who put their trust in Him He still says every day again  let there be light ] and there is light ] in fact He came into this world Himself in the person of His Son Jesus Christ who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said  I am the light of the world  he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life 
The psalmist could say that God was his light even though he could only anticipate the coming of Christ 
He lived in the dawn  he could only see the light coming over the horizon 
We live in the bright daylight of that great event  for us it is a fact in history 
Why should we not have the same faith and an even greater experience of the light which it gives 
This is the faith that moved the psalmist to add his second conception of God  the Lord is my salvation 
He knew that his God would save him from his enemies because He had saved him from his sins 
If God could do that He could do anything 
The enemies at his gate threatening to eat up his flesh were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul 
And God had conquered that one by His grace ] so why worry about all the others 
The apostle Paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the New Testament  He that spared not His own Son but delivered Him up for us all how shall He not with Him freely give us all things 
If God be for us who can be against us 
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ 
Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword 
 Romans 31 32 35  salvation ] this is the key to the conquest of fear 
This gets down to the heart of our problem for it reconciles us with God whom we fear most of all because we have sinned against Him 
When that fear has been removed by faith in Jesus Christ when we know that He is our Savior that He has paid our debt with His blood that He has met the demands of God's justice and thus has turned His wrath away  when we know that we have peace with God in our hearts  and then with this God on our side we can face the whole world without fear 
And so the psalmist gives us one more picture of God  the Lord is the strength of my life 
The word is really stronghold 
It recalls those words of another psalm  God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble 
Therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come behold the works of the Lord what desolations He hath made in the earth 
But again we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century A *d  when an Arabic scholar Tabit Ibn Korra  836 901  is said to have discussed the magic square of three 
Thus while it remains possible that the Babylonians and/or the Pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the Chinese did more definite evidence will have to turn up from the Middle East or the Classical World before China can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years 
2 
The Lo Shu square as an expression of centrality the concept of the Middle Kingdom at peace strong and united under a forceful ruler which had been only a longed for ideal in the time of the Warring States was finally realized by the establishment of a Chinese Empire under the Ch'in dynasty  221 207 B *c  
But this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism 
Among the many severe measures taken by the First Emperor Shih Huang ti in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hard won national unity was the burning of the books in 213 B *c  with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking  but as he had a special fondness for magic and divination he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared 
Many of the latter were destroyed in their turn during the burning of the vast Ch'in palace some ten years later  yet some must have survived because the old interest in number symbolism divination and magic persisted on into the Han dynasty which succeeded in reuniting China and keeping it together for a longer period  from 202 B *c to A *d 220  
In fact during the first century B *c  an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects finding its typical expression in the so called wei books a number of which were specifically devoted to the Lo Shu and related numerical diagrams especially in connection with divination 
However the wei books were also destroyed in a series of Orthodox Confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in 605 
After all this destruction of old literature it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the Lo Shu which was already semisecret anyhow 
But in spite of all this enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive cult  or series of cults  reaching fullest expression in the Han period 
Although modern scholars have expressed surprise that the simple magic square of three a mere mathematical puzzle was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured Chinese for so many centuries they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself 
But up to now no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties or the numerical significance of its numbers  singly or in combination  and then tried to consider these in the light of Old Chinese cosmological concepts 
Such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the Lo Shu 5 was so vitally significant for the Chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of this diagram 
The importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers  quite apart from any numerological considerations which is to say any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it 
Indeed mathematically speaking it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram 
If one takes the middle number 5 and multiplies it by 3  the base number of the magic square of three  the result is 15 which is also the constant sum of all the rows columns and two main diagonals 
Then if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square through multiplying it by the highest number 9  which is the square of the base number  the result is 45  and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed 
Furthermore the middle number of the Lo Shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers by reason of its central position  it is also their mathematical mean since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair all of which equal 10 
In fact the neat balance of these pairs and their subtle equilibrium would have had special meaning in the minds of the Old Chinese 
For they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female equating the two groups with the Yang and Yin principles in Nature  and in this square the respective pairs made up of large and small odd  Yang  numbers and those composed of large and small even  Yin  numbers were all equal to each other 
Thus all differences were leveled and all contrasts erased in a realm of no distinction and the harmonious balance of the Lo Shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis 
The tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the Lo Shu square  for purely mathematical reasons  and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe could well explain why the Old Chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 and why they put so much stress on the concept of Centrality 
These twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the Han dynasty 
The existing reverence for Centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century B *c  when the Han Emperor Wu Ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow  which symbolized the Center among the traditional Five Directions  and took 5 as the dynastic number believing that he would thus place himself his imperial family and the nation under the most auspicious influences 
His immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the Lo Shu but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy 
After this time inscriptions on the Han bronze mirrors as well as other writings emphasized the desirability of keeping one's self at the center of the universe where cosmic forces were strongest 
Later we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally 
All this emphasis on Centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the Center which seems to have begun as far back as 400 B *c  also may conceivably have led to the development of the Five *elements School and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five 
We find for example such groupings as the Five Ancient Rulers the Five Sacred Mountains the Five Directions  with Center  the Five Metals Five Colors Five Tastes Five Odors Five Musical Notes Five Bodily Functions Five Viscera and many others 
This trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the Five Elements itself as though they had served as the base for all the rest  but why did the Old Chinese postulate five elements when the Ancient Near East  which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities  recognized only four 
And why did the Chinese suddenly begin to talk about the Five Directions when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four 
Obviously something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives and that may have been the workings of the Lo Shu 
This whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on Chinese thinking 
Whereas the primary meanings of the Lo Shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties  and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases  the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded Chinese thought 
Scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in Nature or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in China for many centuries 
3 
Yin and Yang in the Lo Shu square although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the Lo Shu and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the Lo Shu held for the Old Chinese philosophers this was actually only a beginning of wonders 
For the Lo Shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time 
As such one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre *han and Han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the Lo Shu but conversely one cannot begin to understand the Lo Shu without knowing something about the world view of the Old Chinese which they felt they saw expressed in it 
The Chinese world view during the Han dynasty when the Lo Shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity was based in large part on the teachings of the Yin *yang and Five *elements School which was traditionally founded by Tsou Yen 
According to this doctrine the universe was ruled by Heaven T'ien  as a natural force or in the personification of a Supreme Sky god  governing all things by means of a process called the Tao which can be roughly interpreted as the Order of the Universe or the Universal Way 
Heaven acting through the Tao expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles the Yin and the Yang 
The Yang or male principle was the source of light heat and dynamic vitality associated with the Sun  while the Yin or female principle flourished in darkness cold and quiet inactivity and was associated with the Moon 
Together these two principles influenced all things and in varying combinations they were present in everything 
We have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being Yang while the even numbers were Yin so that the eight outer numbers of the Lo Shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center 
During the Han dynasty another Yin *yang conception was applied to the Lo Shu considering the latter as a plan of Ancient China 
Instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional Nine Provinces as was usually done this equated the odd Yang numbers with mountains  firm and resistant hence Yang  and the even numbers with rivers  sinuous and yielding hence Yin   taking the former from the Five Sacred Mountains of the Han period and the latter from the principal river systems of Old China 
Thus the middle number 5 represented Sung *shan in Honan Central China  the 3 T'ai *shan in Shantung East China  the 7 Hwa *shan in Shensi West China  the 1 Heng *shan in Hopei North China  or the mountain with the same name in neighboring Shansi   and the 9 Huo *shan in Anhwei which was then the South Sacred Mountain 
For the rivers the 4 represented the Huai to the  then  Southeast  the 2 the San Kiang  three rivers  in the  then  Southwest  the 8 the Chi in the Northeast  and the 6 the  upper  Yellow River in the Northwest 
Note that by Western standards this plan was upside down as it put North at the bottom and South at the top with the other directions correspondingly altered  but in this respect it was merely following the accepted Chinese convention for all maps 
The same arrangement was used when the Lo Shu was equated with the Nine Provinces  and whenever the Lo Shu involved directional symbolism it was oriented in this same fashion 
Few persons who join the Church are insincere 
They earnestly desire to do the will of God 
When they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve Christian stature it is an indictment of the Church 
These fatalities are dramatic evidence of halfway evangelism a failure to follow through 
A program of Lay Visitation Evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship 
The work of Lay Visitation Evangelism is not completed when all of the persons on the Responsibility List have been interviewed 
In the average situation about one third of those visited make commitments to Christ and the Church 
The pastor and the Membership Preparation and Assimilation Committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program 
The first thirty to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine their interest and participation in the life of the Church 
Neglect means spiritual paralysis or death 
Preparation for membership churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members loyal and active 
This is the answer to the problem of membership delinquency 
It is important that persons desiring to unite with the Church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant 
It is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of Church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications 
Preparation for Church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received 
1  the pastor writes a personal letter to each individual expressing his joy over the decision assuring him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time and outlining the plan for membership preparation classes and Membership Sunday 
Some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors 
It should not be postponed later than the next day 
A helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter 
2  the pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference 
If possible he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present 
This is not a social call 
It is definitely a spiritual guidance conference 
He will discuss the significance of Christian commitment the necessity of family religion and private devotions and the importance of the membership preparation sessions 
There may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel 
Each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer 
A piece of devotional material such as the Upper Room may be left in each home 
3  a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults 
Some churches require more 
None should ask less 
Those who join the Church need to be instructed in the faith and the meaning of Christian discipleship before they take the sacred vows 
They will have a greater appreciation for the Church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them 
Many churches find the Sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes 
Others meet on Sunday night at the mid week service or for a series of four nights 
Some pastors have two sessions in one evening with a refreshment period between 
The sessions should cover four major areas  A  the Christian Faith  B  history of the Church  C  duties of Church Membership  D  the Local Church and its program 
Following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the week 
This procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership packet 
Fourth session important most pastors find that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to Reception Sunday 
In this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the local church 
The lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life service opportunities the church school missions men's work women's work youth program social activities and finances 
The budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited at this session 
An interest finder or talent sheet may be filled out by each person 
 see sample on pp 78 79 
 the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the church facilities and refreshments 
The social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members 
Additional suggestions for membership preparation in conducting the Membership Preparation *inquirers' Class the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest on the part of the class 
The following have been found effective 
1  extend the number of classes 
Some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each generally held on Sunday night or during the week 
This gives greater opportunity for the learning process 
2  use dramatization  for example in discussing the Lord's Supper or church symbolism 
3  use audio visual aids 
Some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session 
4  have a Question Box 
Some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly 
Urge them to write out their questions for the box 
5  use a textbook with assigned readings each week 
6  select class members for reports on various phases of the study 
7  conduct examinations using a true false check sheet 
8  ask each member to write a statement on such topics as  What Christ Means To Me What The Church Means To Me Why Join The Church The Duties Of Church Members etc 
9  assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized 
10  invite class members to share in an extra period of Bible study each week 
11  ask each new member to bring his Pledge of Loyalty to the Reception Service 
What about transfers 
There is a growing conviction among pastors and Church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the Church need preparatory training including those coming by transfer of membership 
George E Sweazey writes  there is danger in trying to make admission to the Church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know that anything has happened 
People appreciate experiences that demand something of them 
Those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule 
For most of them it will be their first experience in membership training since this is a recent development in many churches 
Those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed 
The preparatory class is an introductory face to face group in which new members become acquainted with one another 
It provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations 
Reception into the Church Fellowship the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the Church 
This should be a high moment in their lives a never to be forgotten experience 
They should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to Christ our Lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages 
Every detail of the service merits careful attention  the hymns the sermon the ritual the right hand of fellowship the introduction to the congregation the welcome of the congregation 
This is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation 
It will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the Church 
It can mean the difference between participation and inaction spiritual growth and decay 
The worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the Church 
The atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience 
Psychologically the reception should be the climax following the sermon 
1  ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete talent sheets and pledge cards 
Some denominations ask new members to sign personally the chronological membership register 
Provide a name card for each new member 
Outline plans for the entire service 
2  arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together 
Sponsors may sit with them also 
3  invite sponsors or Fellowship Friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service 
4  give each new member a certificate of membership 
5  introduce each new member to the congregation asking him to face the congregation 
6  lead the congregation in a response of welcome 
7  have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service 
8  take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board 
9  have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests 
Chapter 6 planning for the assimilation and growth of new members the church is the family of God 
The members of the family are drawn together by a common love for Christ and a sincere devotion to His Kingdom 
Every member of the family must have a vital place in its life 
This is no spectator type experience  everyone is to be a participant 
Yet the most difficult problem in the Church's program of evangelism is right at this point  helping new members to become participating growing parts of the fellowship 
Very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive 
A study of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty year period revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who joined the Church were lost to the Church within seven years 
One denomination had a membership of 1 419 833 at the beginning of the period under study and twenty years later its membership stood at 1 541 991  a net growth of only 122 158 
Yet during the same period there were 1 080 062 additions 
Another major church body had 4 499 608 members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4 622 444 
During this time 4 122 354 new members were brought into the fellowship 
Still another denomination had 7 360 187 members twenty years ago 
During this period 7 484 268 members were received yet the net membership now is only 9 910 741 
These figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership 
This problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship 
Studies of membership trends even in some areas where population is expanding show that numbers of churches have had little net increase though many new members were received 
Something is wrong when these things happen 
The local family of God has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare 
Basic needs new members can become participating growing members 
But this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life 
It must be planned and carefully developed 
The entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process 
If the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in this book the process of assimilation and growth will be well under way 
Those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with Christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest 
However it is not enough to bring persons to Christian commitment and train them in the meaning of Christian discipleship 
When they unite with the Church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective Christians 
The Church expects certain things of those who become members 
The new members justifiably expect some things from their church family  welcome into the fellowship  sincere Christian love and understanding  inspiring and challenging worship experiences  social and recreational activities  opportunities for Christian service  opportunities for study of the Christian faith and the Bible  creative prayer experiences  guidance in Christian social concerns 
Men need unity and they need God 
Care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with our parochial ideas about him but with these two qualifications the statement stands 
The statement also points to a classic paradox  the more men turn toward God who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another 
To be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones with a resultant fragmentation of the human race 
Massacres attending the partition of India and the establishment of the State of Israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender 
The words of Cardinal Newman come forcibly to mind  oh how we hate one another for the love of God ] the source of this paradox is not difficult to identify 
It lies in institutions 
Institutions require structure form and definition and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion 
A completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms  to escape this fate it must rule some things out 
For every criterion which defines what something is at the same time proclaims  implicitly if not openly  what that something is not 
Some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether  in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification we ought to dispense with churches 
The suggestion is naive 
Man is at once a gregarious animal and a form creating being 
Having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance 
To propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools 
Both eventualities are possible logically but practically they are impossible 
As much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in God they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him 
Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows 
Is there any way out of the predicament 
The only way that I can see is through communication 
Interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries 
Approached creatively it is a high art 
It is the art of relating the finite to the infinite of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart God's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary 
In a certain sense interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation states 
What are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history 
I shall touch on three areas  personal national and theological 
1  by personal factors I mean those rooted in personality structure 
Some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all but by the need of men to have persons they can blame distrust denounce and even hate 
Such needs may rise to pathological proportions 
Modern psychology has shown that paralleling the authoritarian personality is the bigoted personality in which insecurity inferiority suspicion and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally 
Fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us 
To some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us 
Interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all for they have no redeeming features whatsoever 
It is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they rather than pretexts for them that are causing the trouble and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies 
2  while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial nationalism is more variable 
The specific instance I have in mind is the Afro *asian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century 
Emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination the Afro *asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires 
No less than twenty two nations have already achieved independence since World War 2 and the number is growing by the year 
As an obvious consequence obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area  relations between Christians and non *christians in these lands 
Colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious for Christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other 
Actually however this turns out to be only part of the picture 
Nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries 
The truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and Volksgeist which these young nations very much need 
Insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate trans political justifications for their existence such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else's 
All this works severely against the kind of cross cultural communication for which Christian missions stand 
Africans and Asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of Western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda 
The people hardest hit by this suspicion are of course Christians on the mainland of China 
But the problem extends elsewhere 
For example in Burma and Ceylon many Buddhists argue that Buddhism ought to be the official state religion 
In 1960 Ceylon nationalized its sectarian  preponderantly Christian  schools to the rejoicing of most of its 7 000 000 Buddhists and the lament of its 800 000 Roman Catholics 
Again India has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries and fanatical Hindu parties are expected to seek further action against Christians once the influence making for tolerance due to Nehru and his followers is gone 
The progressive closing of Afro *asian ears to the Christian message is epitomized in a conversation I had three years ago while flying from Jerusalem to Cairo 
I was seated next to the director of the Seventh Day Adventists' world radio program 
He said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on Japanese radio networks but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them 
After returning to the United States and raising the money he discovered on getting back to Japan that the hours were no longer available 
It was not that they had been contracted for during the interval  they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes 
It is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti *christian sentiment 
Ironically these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since World War 2 while the more established denominations are barely maintaining pre war staffs 
Although I have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between Christians and non *christians in Asia the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain Afro *asian religions themselves 
The partition of India has hardly improved relations between Hindus and Muslims  neither has the establishment of the State of Israel fostered harmony between Muslims and Jews 
3  I turn finally to several theological developments 
1 
Theocracy reconsidered 
The modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state whatever its political form 
The American Constitution was historic at this point in providing that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof 
One of our foremost jurists David Dudley Field has gone so far as to call this provision the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history 
The trend throughout the world's religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment 
Pakistan was created in 1947 expressly as a Muslim state but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of Islam for the modern political situation 
What is the point Charles Adams reports the Pakistanis as asking in demanding an Islamic state and society if no one not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is 
The current regime of President Mohammad Ayub Khan is determinedly secular 
And while the nation was formerly named The Islamic Republic of Pakistan it is now simply The Republic of Pakistan 
Comparable trends can be noted elsewhere 
The new regime in Turkey is intentionally less Muslim than its predecessor 
The religious parties in Israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months 
During the years when Israel was passing from crisis to crisis  the Sinai campaign the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants  it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties 
Now that Israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions the secularists are less disposed to compromise 
And in this country Gustave Weigel's delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive Roman Catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state 
The failure at that time of the Puerto Rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to Father Weigel's theological argument 
Everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible  in a word too human  to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine

Salvation reconsidered 
My father went as a missionary to China in a generation that responded to Student Volunteer Movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many Chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them 
That mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed 
I do not mean to imply that Christians have adopted the liberal assumption so prevalent in Hinduism that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit 
Leslie Newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the World Council of Churches when he says we must claim absoluteness and finality for Christ and His finished work but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it 
Newbiggin's qualification on the Christian claim is of considerable significance 
The Roman Catholic Church has excommunicated one of its priests Father Feeney for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church 
In mentioning this under salvation reconsidered I do not mean to imply that Roman Catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is 
When they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to permit the termination of the human race by human action because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing they know exactly what they mean 
Of course in prudential calculation in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows 
Yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great or evil repelled sufficiently grave to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action 
I mean however that the moral theologian knows what he means by permit 
He is not talking in the main about probabilities risks and danger in general 
He is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing  and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result  as it efficaciously does some good 
He is talking about double effects of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other but causes both  of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended but still both are done while the evil effect is with equal consciousness on the part of the agent foreknown to be among the consequences 
This is what in a technical sense to only permit an evil result means 
It means to do it and to know one is doing it but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends 
Of course grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation or to the action of any leader or leaders which for any supposed good permits in this sense the termination of the human race by human action 
Certainly in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative 
Naturally where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain this has to be taken into account 
Especially is this true when because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave the action is prohibited 
Presumably if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account 
There must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm 
If an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic speculative future good by the same token not every present certain and immediate good  or lesser evil  that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic speculative and future evil 
Nevertheless according to the traditional theory a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences 
He does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action 
Above all he does not debate mere contingencies and therefore if these are possibly dreadful find himself forced into inaction 
He does what he can and may and must without regarding himself as lord of the future or on the other hand as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not permit in the sense explained 
By contrast a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities and not with the moral nature of the action to be done  and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result whether by anyone's doing or by accident it finds itself driven to inaction to non political action in politics and non military action in military affairs and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based 
Mr Philip Toynbee writes for example that in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues 
If it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin 
Against such a termination of human life on earth by human action he then proposes as an alternative that we negotiate at once with the Russians and get the best terms which are available that we deliberately negotiate from comparative weakness 
He bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically i e  by considering the worst possible outcome namely the total domination of the world by Russia within a few years 
This would be by far the better choice when it is a question of allowing the human race to survive possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish 
Nevertheless the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified  it is a possible result however improbable  the worst and least probable result  if it didn't prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing  for surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war 
If we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms then we need to submit ourselves to the following simple test  have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are 
Thus moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality  it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself its intention and proximate effect or the thing to be done 
Several of the replies to Mr Toynbee without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil 
It is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation 
I am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of race suicide by accident rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design 
But I can only make this choice because I believe that the risk need not increase but may be deliberately reduced  by precautions against accidents or by limiting war 
 quoting Mr Kennan's phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war he  Toynbee  says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war 
If asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility most men will choose the latter 
If Philip Toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war I think he is right 
I do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war 
Even Professor Arnold Toynbee agreeing with his son does so in these terms  compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race all other evils are lesser evils 
Let us therefore put first things first and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be 
Mr Philip Toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of Orwell in Nineteen Eighty *four if he believed Communism was not only evil but also irredeemably evil then he might think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world 
Even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday 
No political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature 
But one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense or a static order in which no changes will take place in time to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact  there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax ordo preserved by clothed or naked force 
On their way to the Heavenly City the children of God make use of the pax ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation 
Not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand 
Toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment 
I would far rather die after a Russian occupation of this country  by some deliberate act of refusal  than die uselessly by atomisation 
Would such an act of refusal be useful 
He does not mean in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition that if we took the risk of surrendering a new generation in Britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender 
He wants to be brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless  far far more hopeless than was the Hungarian revolution of 1956 
This is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war by creating a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited weapons 
It is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it in the past 
It is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples 
Hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop 
This is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted to the very last  it is to stride along the steep slope downward 
The only contrary action in the future as in the past runs the risk of war  and now and in the future unlike in the past any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will by human action render this planet less habitable by the human race 
That is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to permitted effects and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated or not directly morally related to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures 
Finally just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing by human action to accelerate this end 
We should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know not what future 
Much more than shelter housing symbolizes social status a sense of belonging acceptance within a given group or neighborhood identification with particular cultural values and social institutions feelings of pride and worth aspirations and hopes basic to human well being 
For almost one sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self evident by most Americans 
Few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders 
This pressure has urged re evaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics  it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country 
It is not surprising that as spokesman for real estate interests the National Association of Real Estate Boards  N*a*r*e*b  and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure 
How does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race religion or ethnic attachment 
What does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest 
What ought to be what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change 
What social ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation 
Recently a group of the faculty at Wesleyan University's Public Affairs Center sought some answers to these questions 
Several New England realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers political scientists economists social psychologists social ethicists and theologians 
Here in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it 
For a number of years Wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy 
This article presents our observations of that session of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them 
Such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self images held by most realtors 
Within the membership of this group as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations the most ready portrayal of oneself to the public is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them 
Professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner 
But as conversation goes on particularly among the realtors themselves another image emerges that of considerable power and influence in the community 
Obviously much more than customer expectation is determining the realtor's role 
Judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers' income educational level and above all racial extraction  and whether these would qualify them for congenial happy relations to other people in certain community areas 
A narrow professionalism how explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of *j Code of Ethics Article 34 in the Code adopted in 1924 states that a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood 
Though the reference to race was stricken by the association in 1950 being an agent of such detrimental influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid 
The rationale for this avoidance was most frequently expressed in economic terms  all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non white particularly Negro peoples into all white restricted areas 
They would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate professionals but agitators for some kind of cause or reform and this was no longer to be a pro 
Obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of professional with narrow skills and specialization the effective servicing of a client rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one's work 
These men  for the most part educated in our best New England colleges well established financially and socially in the community  under kindly but insistent probing reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a client service relationship 
This narrow professionalism does not even fit the present realities of their situation as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase 
As our discussion continued the inadequacy of the client relationship as an interpretation of their way of operating became evident 
Realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work as members of social and professional organizations as citizens and civic leaders as church laymen as university alumni as newspaper readers etc 
From such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding 
It seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas   1  the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue   2  their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes  and most pervasively  3  their interpretation of who is a real pro of what it means to be a professional man in a technical fragmented society 
 1  most of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society 
There is some reality to this  the Commission on Race and Housing concluded that there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced on the whole than any other segment of the American population 
But such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both *j and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices 
Also it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed 
Like business and university groups generally these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make 
Realtors both generally and in this group have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension 
Recent studies by the Commission on Race and Housing and others however point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion 
There are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the Negroes' desire for well kept housing privacy etc 
Data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in 
Often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically 
Significantly no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes  published by the University of California Press  that present the commission's findings 
No one anticipates any radical shift in this situation but questions concerning reading habits the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised 
The role of both church and university as sources of information and settings within which the implications of such information may be explored needs consideration 
Relevant facts however extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of harmonious neighborhoods 
Discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife 
Against the grain of creation  2  realtors realize of course that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing 
On the positive side recent Federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position  anti discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and while specific provisions have varied the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage 
Realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed interest for example in Connecticut's new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would like to have to obey but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record 
As far as they were aware the Connecticut Association of Real Estate Boards had not officially opposed the bill's passage or lobbied in its support 
 this has not been the case everywhere 
In 1957 the Real Estate Boards of New York City actively opposed the then pending private housing anti discrimination law 
Official reasoning  the bill was a wanton invasion of basic property rights 
 there are sins of omission as well as commission  the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations either negative or positive plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced 
Judicial opinion since the Supreme Court decision on Shelley v Kraemer  1948  has rendered racial restrictive covenants unenforcible 
Such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry but there is little evidence that realtors or at least their associations have repudiated the principle in such clauses 
In the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of social reformism that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid 
But as yet no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all white neighborhoods 
One of the roles of the social scientist ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work 
But responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional white American good 
Such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world let us say a community that embraces Scarsdale or Yonkers but is also infinitely richer since it is all inclusive 
That community of all creation is then the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment 
Racial discrimination is wrong then not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the Creator 
Thus moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions 
A fragmented Society  3  over the years individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed 
Most realtors and real estate brokers talk of themselves as professional people with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions 
But what significance attaches to professional beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a client's stated needs as already noted 
Our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other 
As a theologian in the group pointed out a professional was before the modern period of technical specialization one who professed to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills 
If we look about the world today we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization  science and religion 
Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe the power of the atom 
Religion or the lack of it will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed 
How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge 
We may feel pessimistic at the outlook 
And yet there is a note of hope because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision 
We are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material a universe that in a word is not matter but music 
And it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith 
Atomic energy to see this vision in perspective we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom 
You know that I could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima 
It was only about the size of a baseball  but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20 000 tons of *j 
That is enough *j to fill the tower of the Empire State Building  and with the availability of bombs of that size war became a new problem 
Now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world 
But we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb 
Hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce 
We know that we have hydrogen in water  water is *f and the *j stands for hydrogen  there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies 
I have calculated that if I could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body I would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on Hiroshima 
I won't try the experiment but I think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go there would be quite an explosion 
And then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware Bay or in the ocean beyond 
Salt water is still *f the same hydrogen is there 
And the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today 
Of course there is also an optimistic side to the picture 
For if I knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity I could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body I could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire United States for some days 
And think if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power what a wonderful public utility company we would make 
With just the hydrogen of our bodies we could run the world for years 
Then think of Delaware Bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come 
It is power with which we can literally rebuild the world provide adequate housing food education abundant living for everyone everywhere 
An octillion atoms now let us see where this power comes from 
To grasp our new view of the atom we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is 
I have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry 
One night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms  and I asked myself a question  suppose I had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body how large an area would they cover 
I calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body  that is a figure one with 27 ciphers quite a large number 
Then I calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator  a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic  a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people  and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia 
I saw that I would soon run out of buildings at this rate so I decided to take another measure  the whole state of Pennsylvania 
Imagine that there is a blizzard over Pennsylvania but instead of snowing snow it snows peas  so we get the whole state covered with peas about four feet deep 
You can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars  Pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas 
But we still have a long way to go 
Next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe  North America South America Europe Asia and Africa all covered with peas four feet deep  then we have sextillion peas 
Next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas then we go out among the neighboring stars collect 250 planets each the size of the earth and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep  and then we have septillion 
Finally we go into the farthest reaches of the Milky Way  we get 250 000 planets  we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body 
So you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are 
A speck  and space now although an atom is small we can still in imagination have a look at it 
Let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that I swallow a magic Alice In Wonderland growing pill 
I start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me 
I shoot up through the roof into the sky past the clouds through the stratosphere out beyond the moon out among the planets until I am over a hundred and fifty million miles long 
Then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across a balloon big enough to put a football field inside 
And if you should step inside of such a magnified atom according to the physics of forty years ago you would see circulating over your head down at the sides and under your feet some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs 
These balls are moving in great circles and ellipses and are of course the electrons the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone 
Since these electrons are moving like planets you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom 
So you look down there and you see a tiny whirling point about the size of the head of a pin 
This is the atomic sun the atomic nucleus 
Even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead 
It is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits  it also contains nearly all the mass and the atomic energy 
You may ask what else there is and the answer is nothing  nothing but empty space 
And since you are made of atoms you are nothing much but empty space too 
If I could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper 
Someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing 
At any rate it shows us how immaterial we are 
Music of the spheres now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture 
For we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics  and therefore the atom was really just a little machine  and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts 
So if you are made of atoms you are just a big machine  and since the universe is also made of atoms it is just a supermachine 
And this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe governed by the laws of cause and effect bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom 
And this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists 
Then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920's 
A suggestion from Louis De Broglie a physicist in France showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves 
And to see the meaning of this new picture imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today 
Now as you step inside instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it 
These ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral 
And as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music 
It is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony 
Harmony melody counterpoint symphonic structure are there  and as this music ebbs and flows there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside in fact from the atoms of the entire universe 
And so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music 
The Island of Nantucket part of the State of Massachusetts lies about thirty one miles southeast of its mother State 
Some of the Island is sand and is not suitable for living 
The Island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors  the rest is obtained from harbor scallops 
During about three and a half months of the year in the summer there are three boats that run from the mainland to the Island carrying passengers food and cars  but the rest of the year only one boat is needed which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to Nantucket in the daytime 
This is a fine trip too on a good day 
With Martha's Vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other it makes an excellent trip of about three hours 
To what extent and in what ways did Christianity affect the United States of America in the nineteenth century 
How far and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age 
To what extent did it mould the morals and the social economic and political life and institutions of the country 
A complete picture is impossible  partly because of the limitations of space partly because for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the Christian faith data are unobtainable 
Even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of Christianity from other factors 
Although a complete picture cannot be given we can indicate some aspects of life into which the Christian faith entered as at least one creative factor 
At times we can say that it was the major factor 
What in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation 
As we have seen a growing proportion although in 1914 still a minority were members of churches 
Presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of Christianity to a greater or lesser extent 
Many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in Christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse 
The form of Christianity to which they were exposed was for some the Protestantism of the older stock for others the Protestantism of the nineteenth century immigration  for still others mostly of the nineteenth century immigration it was Roman Catholicism and for a small minority it was Eastern Orthodoxy 
Upon all of them played the intellectual social political and economic attitudes institutions and customs of the nation 
Upon most of these Christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was 
Yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of Christianity would be impossible 
At best only an approximation could be arrived at 
To generalize for the entire nation would be absurd 
For instance we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to Christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose 
The temptation is to say that as the percentage of church members mounted the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level 
Yet this cannot be proved 
We know that in the early part of the century many Protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed 
Thus Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness fighting malicious gossip lying cheating sexual irregularities gambling horse racing and failure to pay just debts 
If guilty the offender might be excluded from membership 
As church membership burgeoned such measures faded into desuetude 
But whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know 
What we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which Christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation 
We have already hinted at the fashion in which Christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life 
We will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to Christian standards and through leaders in the government 
Throughout the nineteenth century Christianity exerted its influence on American society as a whole primarily through the Protestantism of the older stock 
By the end of the century the Roman Catholic Church was beginning to make itself felt mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour 
In the twentieth century its influence grew as did that of the Protestantism of the nineteenth century immigration 
The American dream the ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the Protestantism of the older stock 
Thus America the most widely sung of the patriotic songs was written by a New England Baptist clergyman Samuel Francis Smith  1808 1895  while a student in Andover Theological Seminary 
With its zeal for liberty and its dependence on God it breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the Evangelical revivals 
The great seal of the United States was obviously inspired by the Christian faith 
Here was what was called the American dream namely the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that God could bless it 
Later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of Katherine Lee Bates  1859 1929  daughter and granddaughter of New England Congregational ministers in her widely sung hymn written in 1893 America The Beautiful with the words o beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness 
America America God mend thy every flaw confirm thy soul in self control the liberty in law 
O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears 
America America God shed His grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea 
The American dream was compounded of many strains 
Some were clearly of Christian origin among them the Great Awakening and other revivals which helped to make Christian liberty Christian equality and Christian fraternity the passion of the land 
Some have seen revivalism and the search for Christian perfection as the fountain head of the American hope 
Here too must be placed Unitarianism and less obviously from Christian inspiration Emerson Transcendentalism and the idealism of Walt Whitman 
We must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth  among them Melville Hawthorne and Henry James the elder all of them out of a Christian background 
Reform movements with such a dream arising at least in part from the Protestant heritage of the United States and built into the foundations of the nation it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression 
A number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills 
Significantly the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century came from men and women of New England birth or parentage and from either Trinitarian or Unitarian Congregationalism 
Several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism 
Quakers some from New England had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted 
We do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of New England ancestry also issued the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the Seventh Day Adventists Christian Science the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions the American Home Missionary Society the American Bible Society and New England theology 
The atmosphere was one of optimism of confidence in human progress and of a determination to rid the world of its ills 
The Hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others looked for the early coming of the Millennium and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability cherished by the Unitarians Emerson and the Transcendentalists 
We should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred Evangelicalism of the British Isles and the Pietism of the Continent of Europe  among them prison reform anti slavery measures legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour the Inner Mission and the Red Cross 
We cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills 
A few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose 
Several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century 
Others were ephemeral 
Some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose 
Still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age 
The anti slavery movement the movement to end Negro slavery began before 1815 and mounted after that year until as a result of the Civil War emancipation was achieved 
Long before 1815 the Christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly 
For example in 1693 the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply 
In the latter year Samuel Hopkins from whom the Hopkinsian strain of New England theology took its name asked the Continental Congress to abolish slavery 
As we have seen Methodism early took a stand against slavery 
Beginning at least as far back as 1789 various Baptist bodies condemned slavery 
After 1815 anti slavery sentiment mounted chiefly among Protestants and those of Protestant background of the older stock 
The nineteenth century immigration whether Protestant or Roman Catholic was not so much concerned for very few if any among them held slaves  they were mostly in the Northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out or were too poverty stricken to own slaves 
The anti slavery movement took many forms 
Benjamin Lundy  1789 1839  a Quaker was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti slavery societies 
It was he who turned the attention of William Lloyd Garrison  1805 1879  to the subject 
Garrison Massachusetts born of Nova Scotian parentage was by temperament and conviction a reformer 
Chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of immediate and unconditional abolition he also espoused a great variety of other causes  among them women's rights prohibition and justice to the Indians 
Incurably optimistic dogmatic and utterly fearless in his youth a devout Baptist in spite of his friendship for the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier  1807 1892  he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the Bible 
A marked impulse came to the anti slavery movement through the Finney revivals 
Finney himself while opposed to slavery placed his chief emphasis on evangelism but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the anti slavery campaign 
Theodore Dwight Weld  1803 1895  was especially active 
Weld was the son and grandson of New England Congregational ministers 
As a youth he became one of Finney's band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men 
A strong temperance advocate through the influence of a favorite teacher Charles Stewart another Finney convert he devoted himself to the anti slavery cause 
A group of young men influenced by him enrolled in Lane Theological Seminary and had to leave because of their open anti slavery position 
The majority then went to the infant Oberlin 
They and others employed some of Finney's techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause 
Weld contributed to the anti slavery convictions of such men as Joshua R Giddings and Edwin M Stanton enlisted John Quincy Adams and helped provide ideas which underlay Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin 
He shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame 
Wendell Phillips  1811 1884  from a prominent Massachusetts family in his teens was converted under the preaching of Lyman Beecher 
Although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils he remained a devout Christian 
He was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition but he also stood for equal rights for women for opportunity for the freedmen and for prohibition 
The anti slavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by Arthur Tappan  1786 1865  and his younger brother Lewis Tappan  1788 1873  
Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits  they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer even more terrible abilities 
Their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe 
Royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power 
Thus the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors 
But this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities 
Since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living 
The royal ritual generated power into the other world  it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world 
Proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world  but naturally the royal ritual which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom 
This is the familiar system of cosmic government 
The Chinese emperor by proper observance of ritual manifested divine powers 
He regulated the dualities of light and darkness Yang and Yin which are locked in eternal struggle 
By swaying the balance between them he effected the alternation of the seasons 
His power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions 
In this system no man is exempt from obligations 
Failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's family outrages to community propriety any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead 
And to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters 
The family home was in fact a temple  and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature 
The dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear 
The common belief was that there existed one moral order which included everything 
The dead controlled the material prosperity of the living and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control 
Men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code 
If the moral code were flouted the proper balance of the universe would be upset and the disastrous result could be floods plague or famine 
Modern Westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material largely because in the West the historical trend has been to deny the connection 
Living in urban conditions away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched roof world view the individual may find it possible say to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes 
Basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart  plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns 
In China the magical system par excellence was Taoism 
The Taoists were Quietist mystics who saw an unchanging unity  the Tao  underlying all phenomena 
It was this timeless unity that was all important and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality 
The Taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation  in other words they were actually an organization of magicians 
Mahayana Buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts 
After this form of Indian Buddhism had been introduced into China it underwent extensive changes 
During its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries Mahayana offered a supernatural package to the Chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical Zen morsels offered to the modern Western reader 
Mahayana had gods and magic a pantheon heavens and hells and gorgeously appareled priests monks and nuns all of whom wielded power over souls in the other world 
The self realized Mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic 
The Mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic that made the world into a huge magical garden 
In its monastic form Mahayana was merely an organization of magic practicing monks  bonzes  who catered to the Chinese faith in the supernatural 
Nonmagical Confucianism was a secular rational philosophy but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government 
Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power 
If a man lived a classical life he need not fear the spirits  for only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him 
But let us not be mistaken about Confucian virtue  this was not virtue as we understand the word today and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation 
To the Confucian virtue simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones 
Propriety was synonymous with ritual observance the mark of a true gentleman 
To live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man's fate 
This in brief was the historical background out of which Zen emerged 
Promoters of Zen to the West record its ancestry and recognize that Zen grew out of a combination of Taoism and Indian Mahayana Buddhism 
But the marvelous person that is supposed to result from Zen exhibits more Chinese practicality than Indian speculation  he possesses magical powers and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls 
Proponents of Zen to the West emphasize disproportionately the amount of Mahayana Buddhism in Zen probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical Taoist ideas with more respectable Buddhist metaphysic 
But in the Chinese mind there was little difference between the two  the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be 
Actually Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than it does to Mahayana Buddhism 
The Ch'an  Zen  sect may have derived its metaphysic from Mahayana but its psychology was pure early Taoist 
This is well evidenced by the Quietist doctrines carried over in Zen  the idea of the inward turning of thought the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity peace and stillness  a union with the Infinite with the Tao  could be effected 
In fact the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the direct thinking Zennist was a feature of Taoism 
So too was the insistence on the relativity of the external world and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure indwelling spirit  the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness 
Zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience 
One of its features attractive to the West is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts 
One patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse 
But this is not the spirit of self reliant freedom of action for which the Westerner mistakes it 
It is simply that in Taoist tradition  as in all good mysticisms  books words or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience 
The truth  the Eternal Truth  is not transmittable by words 
Reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge but a positive handicap 
The technique of reality confusion  the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind's grip on reality  originated with fourth and third century B *c Chinese Quietism  the koan is not basically a new device 
It is important for an understanding of Zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man 
In the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdom wide ordering of nature  popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers 
And this is only natural  witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest wonder drug 
Early Chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine personal salvation being achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence 
But this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers 
The anchorite strove in fact to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power 
Thus the Mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distilled down to a bare self seeking and for this reason the mystic in Asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation 
As the Zen literature reveals as soon as an early Zen master attained fame in seclusion he was called out into the world to exercise his powers 
The early Anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles 
Exponents of Zen often insist that very early Zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of China and proposed instead a more mature less credulous view of the universe 
In support of this stories from the early literature are cited to show that Zen attacks the idea of supernatural power 
But actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity  Hwang Pah  O Baku  one day going up Mount Tien Tai which was believed to have been inhabited by Arhats with supernatural powers met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light 
They went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river roaring with torrent 
There being no bridge the master had to stop at the shore  but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to Hwang Pah to follow him 
Thereupon Hwang Pah said  if I knew thou art an Arhat I would have doubled you up before thou got over there ] the monk then understood the spiritual attainment of Hwang Pah and praised him as a true Mahayanist 
 1  a second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess  on one occasion Yang Shan  Kyo zan  saw a stranger monk flying through the air 
When that monk came down and approached him with a respectful salutation he asked  where art thou from 
Early this morning replied the other I set out from India 
Why said the teacher art thou so late 
I stopped responded the man several times to look at beautiful sceneries 
Thou mayst have supernatural powers exclaimed Yang Shan yet thou must give back the Spirit of Buddha to me 
Then the monk praised Yang Shan saying  I have come over to China in order to worship Manjucri and met unexpectedly with Minor Shakya and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from India went back through the air 
 2  in the popular Chinese mind Ch'an  Zen  was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominated 
A closer look at modern Zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular Zen attitudes 
To the Zen monk the universe is still populated with spiritual beings who have to be appeased 
Part of the mealtime ritual in the Zendo consists in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings 
Modern Zen presentation to the West insists on the anti authoritarian highly pragmatic nature of the Zen belief  scriptures are burned to make fire action is based on direct self confidence and so on 
This picture of extreme self reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such Zendo formulas as  o you demons and other spiritual beings I now offer this to you and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith 
 3  Pope Leo 13 on the 13th day of December 1898 granted the following indulgences  an indulgence of three hundred days is granted to all the Faithful who read the Holy Gospels at least a quarter of an hour 
A Plenary Indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading 
Pope Pius the Sixth at Rome in April 1778 wrote the following  the faithful should be excited to the reading of the Holy Scriptures  for these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times 
The American Bishops assembled at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore urged the Catholic people to read the Holy Bible 
We hope they said that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the Holy Scriptures 
They recommended also that at a fixed hour let the entire family be assembled for night prayers followed by a short reading of the Holy Scriptures 
Since the Catholic Church expresses such desire that the Sacred Scriptures be read the following taken from the Holy Bible  New Catholic Edition  will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing

Being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting Christ as Saviour and being convicted by the Holy Spirit of my lost condition I do repent of all effort to be saved by any form of good works and just now receive Jesus as my personal Saviour and salvation as a free gift from Him 
You may do as you please with God now 
It is permitted 
God placed Himself in men's hands when He sent Jesus Christ into the world as perfect God and perfect Man in one Being 
He was then in man's hands 
They cursed Him 
It was permitted 
Men spit on Him 
God allowed it 
They called Him a devil 
God withheld His wrath 
Finally men arrested Him gave Him a mock trial flogged Him nailed Him on a cross and hung Him between earth and heaven  and God allowed it 
You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily present 
You can ignore Him 
You can ignore His Book the Bible and His church 
You can laugh at His blood bought salvation curse His followers and laugh at hell 
It is permitted 
The eternal Christ may knock at your soul's door calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven 
You may refuse Him spit on Him call Him a devil curse Him 
It is permitted 
You may take His name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose 
He is in your hands  now 
On the other hand you may seek His favor humble yourself before Him and beg His mercy implore His forgiveness forsake your sins and abandon your whole life to Him 
He has said behold I stand at the door and knock  if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me  Revelation 3 20  20  
The choice is up to you 
The latch is on your side of the door 
The choice is yours  the revellings and banquetings of this world or quiet communion with God  the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of Holy Spirit discipline 
The choice is yours  God is in your hands now 
God has already set the day when you will be in His hands 
What He does with you then depends on what you do with Him now 
Then it will be a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God if you have abused Him in your hands 
I am a magazine  my name is Guideposts  this issue that you are reading marks my 15th anniversary 
When I came into being 15 years ago I had one primary purpose  to help men and women everywhere to know God better and through knowing Him better to become happier and more effective people 
That purpose has never changed 
When you read me you are holding in your hands the product of many minds and hearts 
Some of the people who speak through my pages are famous  others unknown 
Some work with their hands 
Some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope 
Some are so filled with gratitude for the gift of life and the love of God that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom they have never known and will never see 
Fifteen years ago there were no Guideposts at all 
This month a million Guideposts will circulate all over the world 
Experts in the publishing field consider this astounding 
They do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following 
To me the explanation is very simple 
I am not doing anything of myself 
I am merely a channel for something 
What is this something 
I cannot define it fully 
It is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness even when they turn away from it 
It is the power that holds the stars in their orbits but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass 
It is the whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is 
It is mankind's wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace 
All things are possible to God but He chooses  usually  to work through people 
Sometimes such people sense that they are being used  sometimes not 
Fifteen years ago troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the post war world a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women regardless of creed or color could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living 
The businessman was Raymond Thornburg 
The minister was Norman Vincent Peale 
Neither had any publishing experience but they had faith in their idea 
They borrowed a typewriter raised about $2 000 in contributions hired a secretary persuaded a couple of young men to join them for almost no pay and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called Guideposts 
Compared to the big established magazines my first efforts seemed feeble indeed 
But from the start they had two important ingredients  sincerity and realism 
The people who told the stories were sincere 
And the stories they told were true 
For example early in my life when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of New York's down and outers he didn't just ask questions 
Len Le*sourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days 
That was nearly 13 years ago 
Len Le*sourd is my executive editor today 
Many of you are familiar I'm sure with the story of my early struggles  the fire in January 1947 that destroyed everything  even our precious list of subscribers 
The help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere 
The crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me 
That was when a remarkable woman Teresa Durlach came to my aid  not so much with money as with wisdom and courage 
You're not living up to your own principles she told my discouraged people 
You're so preoccupied that you've let your faith grow dim 
What do you want  a hundred thousand subscribers 
Visualize them then believe you are getting them and you will have them ] and the 100 000 subscribers became a reality 
And then 500 000 
And now a million January Guideposts are in circulation 
With our growth came expansion into new fields of service 
Today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees 
They say all personnel have spiritual needs which Guideposts helps to meet 
Hundreds of civic clubs business firms and individuals make me available to school teachers throughout the land 
They say it helps them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this country was built 
Thousands of free copies are sent each month to chaplains in the Armed Forces to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere 
Bedridden people say I am easy to hold  and read 
Three years ago it became possible to finance a Braille edition for blind readers 
Throughout these exciting years I have been fortunate for although I have never offered great financial inducements talent has found its way to me  William Boal who so ably organizes business operations  John Beach who guides circulation  Irving Granville and Nelson Rector who travel widely calling on business firms 
Searching for the best in spiritual stories my roving editors cover not only the country but the whole world 
Glenn Kittler has been twice to Africa once spending a week with Dr Albert Schweitzer 
Last summer John and Elizabeth Sherrill were in Alaska 
Van Varner recently returned from Russia 
Twice a month the editorial staff meets in New York for an early supper then a long evening of idea exchange 
Around the table sit Protestant Catholic and Jew 
Each contributes something different and something important  Ruth Peale her wide experience in church work  Sidney Fields years of experience as a New York columnist  Catherine Marshall Le*sourd the insight that has made her books world famous and Norm Mullendore the keen perception of an advertising executive 
There are people who travel long distances to assure my continued existence 
Elaine St Johns may fly in from the West Coast for the editorial staff meetings 
Starr Jones gets up every morning at five o'clock milks his family cow attends to farm chores and then takes a two hour train trip to New York

Perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all 
But you see those who are not mentioned will not resent it 
That is the kind of people they are 
Perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs a little sanctimonious 
Not so 
Serious yes but also much laughter 
Sharp division of opinion too and strenuous debate 
There are brain wracking searches for the right word the best phrase the most helpful idea 
And there is also something intangible that hovers around the table 
A good word for it is fellowship 
A shorter word is 
Each meeting starts with a prayer offered love spontaneously by one member of the group 
It takes many forms this prayer but in essence it is always a request for guidance for open minds and gentle hearts for honesty and sincerity for the wisdom and the insights that will help Guideposts' readers 
For you readers are an all important part of the spiritual experiment that is Guideposts 
I need your support your criticism your encouragement your prayers 
I am a magazine  my name is Guideposts 
My message today is the same as it was 15 years ago  that there is goodness in people and strength and love in God

Havana was filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of men's eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices 
The hated dictator Batista had fled 
Rumors flew from lip to lip that Fidel Castro was on his way to Havana coming from the mountains where he had fought Batista for five years 
Already the city was filled with Barbudos the bearded war dirty Revolutionaries carrying carbines waving to the crowds that lined the Prado 
And then Castro himself did come bearded smiling  yet if you looked closely you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips 
At first I was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man 
I am sure that Castro was happy too about that support 
Diario De La Marina was the oldest and most influential paper in Cuba with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny 
My grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials 
My own earliest memories are of exiles  my three brothers and I were taken often to the United States to visit relatives while my father stayed on to fight the dictator Machado 
When it was my turn I too printed the truth as I knew it about Batista and rejoiced to see his regime topple 
None of us was aware that the biggest fight was still ahead 
I was full of hope as Fidel Castro came into Havana 
Within a week however I began to suspect that something was wrong 
For Castro was bringing Cuba not freedom but hatred 
He spent long hours before the *j spitting out promises of revenge 
He showed us how he dealt with his enemies  he executed them before *j cameras 
On home sets children were watching the death throes of men who were shot before the paredon the firing wall 
Castro's reforms 
He seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance 
New schools were rising but with this went a harsh proclamation  any academic degree earned during Batista's regime was invalid 
Economic aid 
He had promised cheaper housing  arbitrarily he cut all rents in half whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room 
Under another law hundreds of farms were seized 
Farm workers had their wages cut almost in half 
Of this only 50 cents a day was paid in cash the rest in script usable only in People's Stores 
A suspicion was growing that Fidel Castro was a Communist 
In my mind I began to review  his use of hate to gain support  his People's Courts  his division of society into two classes one the hero the other the villain 
But most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the Palace  many came from Communist countries 
What should I do about it I asked myself 
I had watched Castro handling his enemies before the paredon 
There was no doubt in my mind that if I crossed him mobs would appear outside our windows shouting paredon ] paredon ] what should I do 
I was proud of the new buildings which housed Diario now  the rotogravures gleaming behind glass doors  the thump and whir of our new presses 
Here was a powerful ready made medium but it could speak only if I told it to 
Then one day early in January 1960 I sat down at my desk and suddenly I was aware of the crucifix 
It was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had given me 
I had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a Christian manner 
Now it seemed almost as if Jesus were looking down at me with sadness in His eyes saying  you will lose the paper 
You may lose your life 
But do in that you have any choice 
I knew moment that I did not have any choice 
From that day on I began to write editorials about the things I did not think correct in Fidel Castro's regime 
Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents don't want sonny boy to lift all those old barbell things because you'll stunt your growth or because childish taunts from his schoolmates like hey lookit Mr America  whaddya gonna do with all those muscles  of which he has none at the time  
After all a guy's gotta have a little ego ] therefore it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ] this happy always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior Mr Canada  Henri De Courcy 
Far from discouraging Henri his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments 
Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority Professor Roland Claude 
And they couldn't have entrusted Henri to better hands because le professeur knows his muscles from the sterno cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast fast muscle growth 
That's because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt Royal East in Montreal 
Undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize winning pupils  every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other  
There's Gaetan D'*amours who is our newest Mr Canada  Jean *paul Senesac whose story appeared here two issues ago  Jack Boissoneault who was with us last month  Charles Harve who recently won the Most Muscular Man subdivision award in the Mr Canada event  and a host of others 
Yesiree the professor knows his muscles ] now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4' 10'' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight 
About that time he began reading Mr America and Muscle Builder and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight gaining 
Seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of Quick *wate and Super *protein those two wonder working Weider food supplements he decided to try them and see what they could do for him 
Well sir they did real great ] for in almost less time than it takes to tell it Henri's bodyweight was increasing rapidly 
Of course he did some exercising 
He's crazy about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame 
Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much 
But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body 
It was muscular but it wasn't symmetrical 
A real nothing torso says Henri 
It never seemed to widen 
It just got longer and longer 
That's when he went to Professor Claude 
And at once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it 
In his gym the professor has some of the most knocked out equipment since Vic Tanny 
Mr Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now famous Weider Push *pull Super *set technique in which one exercise of the Super *set is a pressing or pushing movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way followed by a pulling exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group 
So right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous moon bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push *pull Super *set consisting of the wide grip Straight *arm Pullover  the pull part of the Push *pull Super *set  which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collar to collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide Reeves type gladiator *j while stimulating the upper *j and frontal deltoids 
As you can see in this Push *pull Super Set the entire chest back shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped up all the time ] now when Henri has completed four complete Push *pull Super *sets No 1 the professor allows him about a five minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push *pull Super *sets No 2 
Super *set No 2 is made up of similar exercises but this time done with dumbbells and using both moon and flat benches 
The push exercise of this Push *pull Super *set is the Bench Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation 
You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the *j 
The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the *j 
The pull exercise in this Super *set is the one dumbbell Bent *arm Pullover 
 note how strongly the upper *j and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords  
In the third Push *pull Super *set the push exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars while the pull exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms 
The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral ribcage stretcher ever invented ] this is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved 
You'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch ] as you see the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w i d e grip 
He has to  he just can't do anything about it at all ] but as you can also see it's not a painful exercise at all because Henri De Courcy  the happy bodybuilder  looks as though he were having the time of his life ] the last exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets 
By this time Henri's entire chest back lat shoulder area is pumped up to almost bursting point and Claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral front deltoid shaping work 
He has Henri do from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press  note the high incline  
This gives a wide flare to the *j causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and *j 
This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests  that steel edged carved out of solid rock looks of the great champions 
So with four complete Push *pull Super *sets No 1 four of No 2 four of No 3 and four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press you can see that Henri De Courcy has had a terrific mass building muscle shaping torso defining workout that cannot be improved upon 
Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone 
Rarer still is a Mr America or Mr Universe of true Herculean build 
The aspects of physical development that catch the judges' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion  superior definition of the muscles 
Now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high set high rep light weight workouts 
But contest definition  that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's chisel  is something quite different 
This comes not alone from high set high rep training but from certain definition specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him 
Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others 
Because they are minority exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten 
Only when the newest Mr America or Mr Universe discovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are 
The exercise I shall discuss in this  the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition specialization of a particular body part  is the One Leg Lunge 
Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone no matter whether he has short or long thigh bone lengths ] it is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline  that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders  a criterion of muscle drama that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike  the facet of muscular development that wins prizes 
Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which is easily understandable 
The One Leg Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts 
But for purely definition purposes  used in conjunction with your regular Squatting Leg Curling Leg Extensor programs  a heavy weight is not needed 
Indeed a lighter weight works much better because a greater more extensive split can be performed 
Used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razor sharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin ] really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times for the following suggestions show why it is so effective  1 
It's a complete thigh contraction extension exercise 
2 
It places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition 
3 
It improves over all balance and control for the bodybuilder and helps to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed 
4 
It increases flexibility of the legs 
5 
It speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately thus enabling a massive concentrated effort to be focused on each 
You'll need your Weider Power Stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's done  1 
Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean 
2 
Place a suitably loaded barbell across them  grasp the bar  which will rest against the back of your neck   extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split 
Now raise the weight by straightening your front leg without moving your feet 
When the front knee is straight and locked allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the Power Stands 
3 
After you have taken a breather reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear and the rear thigh now to the front and perform the same movement in the same manner 
That's the One *leg Lunge in a nutshell 
You should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety 
You should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance wise 
Oh you'll wobble and weave quite a bit at first 
But don't worry 
Before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran ] although I suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck 
Squat style lifters and leg split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front 
The most beautiful bed of pansies I've seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day 
Pansies are supposed to like it cool but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun 
I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather 
He seemed puzzled by my question 
I just love them he said 
The more I talked with him the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming 
Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care 
He planted the pansy seeds himself buying them from a pansy specialist 
These specialists I learned have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers 
Their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains 
I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants 
Occasionally when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did  but pansy seeds he told me soon run down 
It's best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them 
His soil was nothing special just prairie land but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose spongy and brown black 
I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture tilth and body 
It isn't easy to describe it but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil 
Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies 
They germinate quickly the tiny plants appearing in a week and grow along lustily 
It doesn't really matter which month of the year you sow them but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours 
I like to make a seedbed right in the open though many people start them successfully in cold frames 
Pansies don't have to be coddled  they'd rather have things rugged with only moderate protection on the coldest days 
If you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate 
For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting 
I dig it rake it smooth sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray 
Then I cover the sowing with a board 
This keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds 
Ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby 
When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board 
A light porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth 
I like sawdust for this or hay 
When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants it's time to set them out where they are to remain 
Every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller 
The moral is  don't transplant it any oftener than you must 
As soon as they are large enough to move I put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom 
I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant 
That encourages rooting and the better developed the roots the larger and more plentiful the flowers 
Pansies are gluttons 
I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them 
I spade lots of compost into their bed  lacking that decayed manure spread over the bed is fine 
One year I simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile to which a little sand had been added and I had the most beautiful pansies in my or any of my neighbors' experience 
In addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week diluted to the color of weak tea 
As a substitute for this organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions may be used 
They need mulch 
We put a light mulch over the seedlings  now we must use a heavy one 
Three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool 
When winter comes be ready with additional mulch 
I like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost 
That keeps in the cold retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing 
Don't miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter 
Whenever there is a thaw or a few sunny days you'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two 
If those aren't enough for you why not grow some just for winter blooming 
The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February during a particularly cold winter 
I started the seed in a flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame 
 an unheated greenhouse would have been better if I had had one 
 the plants took zero nights in their stride with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them 
In response to the lengthening days of February they budded then bloomed their 4 inch velvety flowers 
That cold frame was my morale builder  its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it 
Like strawberries in December pansies are far more exciting in February than in May 
Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it 
The day will come in midsummer when you find your plants becoming leggy running to tall growing foliage at the expense of blossoms 
Try pegging down each separate branch to the earth using a bobby pin to hold it there 
Pick the flowers keep the soil dampened and each of the pegged down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season 
As soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over cut it off from the mother plant 
A second and also good practice is to shear off the tops leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch 
These cut down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring 
I like to shear half my plants at a time leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming 
Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed 
Nature's aim different from ours is to provide for the coming generation 
That done her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant 
Here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds 
Go to a reputable grower preferably a pansy specialist 
It is no harder to raise big healthy blooming plants than weak sickly little things  in fact it is easier 
But you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow 
Many people think that pansies last only a few weeks then their period of growth and bloom is over 
That is not true 
If the plants are cared for and protected over the winter the second year is more prolific than the first 
Would you like to grow exhibition pansies 
Remove about half the branches from each plant leaving only the strongest with the largest buds 
The flowers will be huge 
Pansies have character 
They stick to their principles insist upon their due but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it 
Treat them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones 
Give them food some shade mulch water and more food and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty 
A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal but add an avocado and you have something really special 
This delightful tropical fruit has become well known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocados anywhere in the United States 
It has a great many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part of your diet yet you really should 
You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted 
It is roughly shaped like a large pear and when properly ripened its dark green skin covers a meaty melon like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe Bartlett pear but oily 
The avocado should have a give to it as you hold it when it is ripe 
The flavor is neither sweet like a pear nor tart like an orange  it is subtle and rather bland nut like 
It is a flavor that might take a little getting used to  not because it is unpleasant but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits 
Sometimes it takes several eatings of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world 
Once you become an avocado fan you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation 
Naturally dormant and no spray danger today refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world 
The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree but it is still firm at this point 
It is brought to packing houses cleaned and graded as to size and quality and packed in protective excelsior 
The fruit is then cooled to 42 degrees *f  a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state 
This cooling does not change the avocado in any way it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grovelike temperature  room temperature  is restored 
This happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen 
One of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind 
There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed 
If the temperature is controlled properly the avocado will delay its ripening until needed 
And unlike other fruits one cannot eat the skin of the avocado 
It is thick much like an egg plant's skin so that poison sprays if they are used present no hazard to the consumer 
Nutritious and a cholesterol reducer good taste and versatility plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit even if its nutritional values were limited 
Avocados however are very rich in nutrients 
Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system 
Aside from this the average portion contains some protein an appreciable amount of vitamins *j and *j  about one tenth of the minimum daily requirement and about a third of the official vitamin *j requirement 
The *j vitamins are well represented especially thiamin and riboflavin 
Calcium phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts 
None of these values is destroyed not significantly altered by refrigeration storage 
Dr Wilson C Grant of the Veterans' Administration Hospital Coral Gables Florida and the University of Miami School of Medicine set out to discover if avocados because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients 
The study comprised 16 male patients ranging in age from 27 to 72 
They were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible the normal cholesterol level of their blood 
Then they were given 1/2 to 1 1/2 avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption 
Five four three two one fire ] the tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard 
The pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach 
Never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear 
Nuclear weapons are fearsome but the long range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying 
A great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets 
It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker in possession of such absolute power would simultaneously destroy his opponent's cities and people 
With a nation defenseless before it why would the attacker spare the victim's people 
Wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation 
The nation would be utterly devastated 
The will of its people so crucial in time of peril would be broken 
Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self destruction in hours or days  and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes 
At this point it should be painfully obvious that cities being soft and the people within them are ideally suited to destruction by nuclear weapons 
However because this vulnerability is mutual it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent's cities at least so long as the opponent has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal 
It should be appallingly apparent that city trading is not a profitable military tactic 
I*c*b*ms have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways 
They could be used to attack a nation's people  which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker's own people  or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military force 
If our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles 
We must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves 
We must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile 
Missiles are very valuable weapons but they also have their too little known limitations 
Because of a missile's ballistic trajectory the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately 
Placing missiles in submarines on barges railroads highways surface vessels and in the air provides them with passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long range ballistic missiles today  the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons 
One must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target decide that it is worthy of destruction select the missile to be fired against the target compute ballistics for the flight and prepare the missile for firing 
Even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously the *j still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes 
Therefore if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes the probability of having destroyed it is drastically lowered 
Because of this it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self protection in mobility  at least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability 
In order to destroy the enemy's mobile moving or imprecisely located strategic forces we must have a hunter killer capability in addition to our missiles 
Until this hunter killer operation can be performed by spacecraft manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us 
It seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's citizens to cinders we must have a manned strategic force of long endurance aircraft capable of going into China or Russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us 
Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail mobile *j force 
It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the *j or *j in hunter killer operations against Soviet railway based missiles 
If we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets it would seem that the *j or *j could carry a great many small nuclear weapons 
An aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains operating within a specified geographic area of Russia  provided that we had used some of our *j to degrade Russia's air defenses before our bombers got there 
The aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile fleeting and imprecisely located targets as well as the known fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile
